## 1. Strategic Foundation

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes the vision, mission, and guiding principles for California's modernization, explains why government lacks natural efficiency mechanisms, and describes how ODI and GovOps serve as foundational partners.

### 1.1 Vision Statement

California state government operates with the efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation of leading organizations while maintaining public sector values of equity, transparency, and accessibility. Every Californian experiences government services that are digital-first, user-centered, and seamlessly integrated across agencies—delivered through empowered teams using modern tools, shared data, artificial intelligence, and continuous improvement practices that make government as responsive as the best private sector organizations.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

Transform California's government operations through the Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model, creating institutional forcing mechanisms that drive continuous improvement, technological modernization, and excellence in public service delivery. By establishing empowered leadership positions, independent data governance, continuous talent development, and sustainable funding mechanisms, California will demonstrate that government can deliver exceptional outcomes while remaining accountable, transparent, and equitable.

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

**Citizen-Centric Design:**
Every technology investment and process change must clearly improve citizen experiences. User research, accessibility testing, and satisfaction measurement inform all decisions. Services should be organized around life experiences—not organizational charts.

**Evidence-Based Decision Making:**
Data, metrics, and rigorous evaluation guide resource allocation, project prioritization, and performance assessment. Transparency in both successes and failures enables organizational learning.

**Actual Authority:**
Modernization leaders and governance bodies must have real decision-making power—not merely advisory roles. Without authority, modernization becomes optional; with authority, it becomes inevitable.

**Qualified Leadership:**
Technical positions require verified technical competence. The Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) framework ensures CIOs, CISOs, CDOs, and CTOs possess demonstrated expertise. See [Executive Accountability](executive-accountability.md) for standards.

**Readiness-Based Deployment:**
Strategic use of the Readiness Assessment framework ensures resources flow to departments positioned for success, creating early wins that build momentum.

**Open and Collaborative:**
California's modernization serves as an open-source model for peer states. Collaboration with private sector partners, academic institutions, and other governments accelerates progress.

**Equity and Inclusion:**
Digital transformation must not create new barriers for underserved populations. Multi-language support, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum), and alternative service channels ensure universal access.

**Sustainable and Scalable:**
Solutions must work at California's scale (40 million residents, 170 departments, 230,000+ employees) and remain maintainable over decades. Avoid vendor lock-in.

**Security and Privacy by Design:**
Cybersecurity, data privacy (CCPA compliance), and ethical AI use are embedded from project inception, not added retrospectively.

### 1.4 The Core Problem

Private sector organizations face market-driven pressure to optimize operations. Poor efficiency leads to higher costs, reduced competitiveness, declining revenue, and potential business failure. This forcing mechanism drives continuous improvement, innovation, and accountability.

Government agencies operate without this pressure. Budget allocations continue regardless of operational efficiency. Services remain monopolistic—citizens cannot choose alternative providers. The incentive structure rewards maintaining the status quo.

**Measurable Consequences (2024-2025 Data):**

#### Legacy System Crisis
Legacy systems consume 70-80% of IT budgets, leaving 20-30% for innovation. The average age of critical systems exceeds 25 years, with some mainframes dating to the 1970s. These systems require increasingly scarce technical expertise (COBOL, Fortran, AS/400) and face mounting failure risks.

#### Data Fragmentation
Over 400 independent systems prevent information sharing, forcing citizens to provide the same information multiple times. Data sharing agreements take 12-18 months to negotiate, creating barriers to cross-agency collaboration.

#### Procurement Delays
Traditional procurement cycles average 12-18 months, delaying technology adoption and compounding costs. Large monolithic contracts create vendor lock-in and concentrate risk.

#### Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities
Outdated infrastructure exposes citizen data to threats. Systems lacking modern security controls (MFA, encryption, zero-trust) create organizational risk.

#### Workforce Skills Gap
33% of government workers have low or no digital skills despite 92% of jobs requiring them. Compensation gaps of 20-40% drive talent attrition. Average IT worker age exceeds 50, creating knowledge loss risk.

#### Executive Qualification Gap
CIO, CISO, CDO, and CTO positions have no domain-specific competence requirements under current CalHR standards. The State Auditor has flagged IT oversight as high-risk for 18 consecutive years. See [Executive Accountability](executive-accountability.md) for the Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) solution.

#### Service Delivery Gaps
Citizens navigate fragmented services designed around bureaucratic structures rather than user needs. Multi-language support and accessibility compliance remain inconsistent.

#### Innovation Deficit
Risk-averse cultures penalize failure more than they reward innovation. First-mover disadvantage discourages initiative.

#### AI Readiness Gap
California lacks foundations for effective AI adoption: fragmented data, outdated infrastructure, and absent governance frameworks. Without deliberate preparation, the state will miss opportunities to improve efficiency and citizen service.

California cannot rely on organic improvement. These structural problems require structural solutions.

### 1.5 The Office of Data and Innovation: Pioneer and Partner

The **Office of Data and Innovation (ODI)** has pioneered the approaches this plan scales statewide. ODI provides innovation methods (CalInnovate), training infrastructure (CalAcademy), technical standards (California Design System, API standards), and data governance leadership.

**ODI's Role in This Plan:**

The proposed E3 Operational Model would create empowered champions at every agency who can mandate adoption of ODI-developed tools, practices, and standards:

- **Innovation Methods:** CalInnovate approaches become standard practice
- **Training Infrastructure:** CalAcademy becomes foundational training for all E3 leaders
- **Technical Standards:** ODI-developed API standards and design systems become mandatory
- **Partnership Model:** E3 leaders allocate budget for ODI services
- **Performance Analytics:** ODI expertise supports TMO performance measurement

**ODI Collaboration with E3 Leadership:**

| Service | ODI Role | E3 Leader Role | Governance |
|---------|----------|----------------|------------|
| **CalInnovate** | Deliver service design sprints | Mandate participation; fund projects | E3 Undersecretary sponsors |
| **CalAcademy** | Develop curriculum; deliver training | Require completion for E3 staff | TMO tracks completion |
| **Design System** | Maintain California Design System | Mandate use for citizen services | CDT enforces compliance |
| **Data Standards** | Develop templates, schemas | Adopt and implement | Independent Office reviews |

### 1.6 Government Operations Agency: Coordination Hub

The **Government Operations Agency (GovOps)** serves as California's management and efficiency agency, housing CDT, ODI, CalHR, and DGS.

**Transformation Management Office (TMO) within GovOps:**
- Provides centralized coordination, portfolio management, performance tracking
- Supports (but does not control) E3 Undersecretaries across all agencies
- Creates visibility and accountability without exercising direct authority

**Leveraging GovOps Expertise Statewide:**
- **CDT** provides technology standards, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure
- **ODI** provides innovation methods, human-centered design, CalAcademy training
- **CalHR** provides workforce planning, classification support, change management, and TEA qualification standards
- **DGS** supports procurement innovation and modular contracting

## 2. The E3 Operational Model

> **Section Summary:** This section defines the governance architecture for the E3 Operational Model, including roles, responsibilities, authorities, and deployment strategy for Undersecretaries, Chief Deputy Directors, and the Transformation Management Office. Technical positions with IT responsibility require Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) qualifications—see [Section 2.6](#26-technical-executive-standards-integration) and [Executive Accountability](executive-accountability.md).

The E3 Operational Model establishes explicit accountability for modernization through new leadership positions with direct authority over technology, process, and organizational transformation.

```

### 2.2 E3 Undersecretary Positions (Strategic Leadership and Agency Coordination)

**Position Overview:**
E3 Undersecretaries operate at the Agency level, reporting directly to Agency Secretaries while coordinating statewide efforts through the TMO and Statewide E3 Council. These positions hold explicit authority over technology modernization, business process optimization, data governance, and performance management.

**Technical Executive Assignment Requirement:**
E3 Undersecretaries with significant technology portfolio responsibility (oversight of agency IT strategy, architecture approval, cybersecurity posture) must meet Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) qualifications. See [Section 2.6](#26-technical-executive-standards-integration) and [Executive Accountability](executive-accountability.md) for qualification pathways.

**Why This Position Matters:**
Without E3 Undersecretaries, modernization efforts fragment across departments with no strategic coordination. E3 Undersecretaries provide agency-level strategic direction, ensure cross-department interoperability, and create forcing function for consistent progress.

For sample position descriptions, see [Template A.1](../appendices/templates.md#a1-e3-position-description-template).

**Deployment Strategy:**

*Recommendation: Begin with 8 E3 Undersecretaries covering highest-priority agencies, with expansion to 12 based on results.*

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Deploy to 4 agencies (GovOps, CalHHS, Transportation, Corrections)
- **Phase 2 (Months 7-18):** Expand to 4 additional agencies
- **Phase 3 (Months 19-36):** Expand to remaining agencies (8-12 total)

**Comprehensive Responsibilities:**

| Domain | % | Key Focus |
|--------|---|-----------|

### 2.3 E3 Chief Deputy Director Positions (Operational Execution and Department Transformation)

**Position Overview:**
E3 Chief Deputy Directors operate within departments, reporting to Department Directors while coordinating with agency-level E3 Undersecretaries and TMO. These positions hold operational responsibility for modernization execution.

**Technical Executive Assignment Requirement:**
E3 Chief Deputy Directors with direct IT delivery responsibility (managing IT staff, overseeing IT projects, IT budget authority) must meet Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) qualifications. See [Section 2.6](#26-technical-executive-standards-integration) and [Executive Accountability](executive-accountability.md) for qualification pathways.

**Why This Position Matters:**
Department Directors manage complex operations with competing priorities. Modernization often falls to the bottom without dedicated leadership. E3 Chief Deputy Directors provide persistent focus on transformation, bridging strategic vision and operational reality.

**Deployment Strategy:**

*Recommendation: Deploy 30 E3 CDDs initially to departments with highest readiness and citizen impact, with expansion to 40 based on results.*

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-12):** Deploy to 10 highest-readiness departments
- **Phase 2 (Months 13-24):** Expand to 20 additional departments
- **Phase 3 (Months 25-36):** Expand to remaining departments (30-40 total)

**Comprehensive Responsibilities:**

**Decision Authority Matrix:**

| Decision Type | Under $500K | $500K-$2M | $2M-$5M | Over $5M |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Project Approval** | CDD approves | CDD approves; Undersecretary notified | CDD recommends; Undersecretary approves | Undersecretary + TMO review |
| **Vendor Selection** | CDD approves | CDD approves; Undersecretary notified | CDD recommends; Undersecretary approves | Undersecretary + CDT consultation |
| **Data Sharing** | CDD approves (Template 1-2) | CDD recommends; Undersecretary approves | Undersecretary approves (Template 3) | Independent Office review (Template 4) |

### 2.4 Transformation Management Office (TMO)

**Purpose:**
The TMO provides centralized coordination, portfolio management, performance tracking, and support services. Without TMO, modernization efforts risk becoming fragmented silos.

**Why TMO Matters:**
Without coordination:
- **Duplicated Effort:** Agencies build similar solutions independently
- **Incompatibility:** Independently developed systems cannot interoperate
- **Missed Learning:** Successful innovations remain siloed
- **Resource Waste:** Agencies compete for same vendors

TMO prevents these pathologies by creating visibility, managing dependencies, enabling reuse, and building community.

**Organizational Placement:**
- **Reports to:** GovOps Secretary
- **Coordinates with:** Statewide E3 Council, ODI, CDT, Independent Office, Finance
- **Supports:** All E3 Undersecretaries and CDDs across all agencies

**Staffing:** 16-23 staff across Portfolio Management, Performance Analytics, Change Management, Innovation, and Administration.

**Key Functions:**

**Portfolio Management:** Maintain centralized view of all modernization initiatives. Track dependencies. Manage stage-gate reviews. Monitor budget and schedule performance.

**Performance Measurement:** Define and maintain statewide KPI framework. Collect performance data. Produce quarterly dashboards. Publish public transparency reports.

**Knowledge Management:** Document lessons learned. Maintain playbooks and templates. Facilitate Communities of Practice.

**Change Management Support:** Provide consulting using ADKAR framework. Coordinate CalAcademy training. Support culture change initiatives.

**Innovation Coordination:** Manage Governor's Innovation Fellowship logistics. Coordinate Breakthrough Fund partnerships. Operate innovation sandbox.

### 2.5 California Innovation Council Interface

In December 2025, the Governor established the California Innovation Council with four working groups. The E3 Operational Model provides execution capacity for council policy recommendations.

**Council Working Group Alignment:**

| Council Working Group | Lead Agencies | E3 Liaison |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------|
| Modernizing Government Service Delivery | GovOps, CDT, ODI | TMO Director + GovOps E3 Undersecretary |
| Technology, Economic Development and Workforce | GO-Biz, Labor | Labor E3 Undersecretary |
| Countering Tech Fraud | Business, Consumer Services | Business E3 Undersecretary |
| Protecting Child Online Safety | First Partner's Office, CDT | CalHHS E3 Undersecretary |

**Interface Responsibilities:**
- **Policy-to-Operations Flow:** E3 Undersecretaries translate council recommendations into implementation plans
- **Operational Feedback:** E3 leaders provide ground-level insights to inform council deliberations
- **Portfolio Integration:** Council-prioritized initiatives receive expedited consideration

### 2.6 Technical Executive Standards Integration

> **See also:** [Executive Accountability](executive-accountability.md) for complete TEA framework, qualification pathways, and Executive Order language.

**Purpose:**
The Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) framework ensures that technology leadership positions are filled by executives with verified technical competence—addressing the root cause of California's 18-year high-risk IT oversight status.

**Which E3 Positions Require TEA Qualification:**

| Position | TEA Required? | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| E3 Undersecretary (with technology portfolio) | **Yes** | Approves architectures, IT investments, cybersecurity posture |
| E3 Undersecretary (non-technology focus) | No | Focus on business process, not IT delivery |
| E3 Chief Deputy Director (with IT responsibility) | **Yes** | Manages IT projects, staff, budget |
| E3 Chief Deputy Director (non-IT focus) | No | Focus on operations, not technology |

**Qualification Pathways:**

TEA qualification may be demonstrated through any of three pathways:

1. **Professional Certification** — CISSP, CISM, PMP, TOGAF, ITIL Expert, or equivalent
2. **Demonstrated Experience** — 10+ years technical leadership with documented outcomes
3. **Independent Technical Panel** — Three-person evaluation (CalHR, CDT, external expert)

**Appointing Authority Requirements:**

Secretaries and Department Directors appointing to TEA-covered positions must:
- Verify candidate meets TEA qualification through one of the three pathways
- Document technical qualifications assessment in writing
- Obtain independent technical review for positions above $200K
- Certify understanding of position's technical scope

**Integration with E3 Hiring:**

- **Phase 1 (CDT Pilot):** All new E3 positions at CDT filled using TEA process
- **Phase 2 (Agency Expansion):** TEA requirements extend to agency E3 Undersecretaries with technology portfolios
- **Phase 3 (Statewide):** All covered E3 positions require TEA qualification

**Performance Accountability:**

E3 leaders in TEA-covered positions have performance objectives that include measurable technical outcomes:
- Project delivery (on-time, on-budget, meeting requirements)
- Security posture (incidents, vulnerabilities, compliance)
- Operational effectiveness (system availability, user satisfaction)
- Team development (retention, skills advancement, succession planning)

## 3. Product-Led Delivery Framework

> **Section Summary:** This section describes the technical delivery approach, including service mesh architecture, citizen journey teams, and integration with procurement.

### 3.1 Service Mesh Architecture

**Vision:** Replace monolithic point-to-point integrations with service mesh where every system exposes APIs and discovers services through a catalog. This architecture is foundational for AI adoption.

**API Standards:**
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0+ specs
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Agency API catalogs for discovery
- AI-ready data formats

**Implementation:**
1. Pilot with high-value cross-agency services
2. Mandate for all new procurements
3. Retrofit legacy with API wrappers
4. TMO maintains statewide catalog

### 3.2 Citizen Journey Teams

Citizen Journey Teams bring together E3 Undersecretaries, E3 Chief Deputy Directors, subject matter experts, and Fellows to redesign citizen experiences around life events (having a baby, starting a business, disaster recovery) rather than agency boundaries.

Teams follow a 12-month operating model: formation, discovery, design, build, and ongoing measurement.

For complete operating procedures, see [Appendix B.5](../appendices/operational-guides.md#b5-citizen-journey-teams-operating-guide).

### 3.3 Procurement Integration

Product-led delivery requires procurement that moves at the speed of product development. California integrates contracting directly into the Product Delivery Lifecycle through Enterprise Vendor Pools, modular contracting ($15M cap), and Rapid RFI² challenge-based procurement.

For comprehensive procurement framework, see [Procurement](procurement.md).
