## 1. Strategic Context

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes why executive accountability reform is essential for California's modernization success, how it relates to the E3 Operational Model, and the scope of proposed reforms.

### 1.1 The Accountability Gap

California's enterprise modernization cannot succeed without qualified technical leadership. The [E3 Operational Model](governance-model.md) creates new positions and governance structures for transformation—but the state's existing executive framework lacks the mechanisms to ensure technical competence in IT leadership roles.

**The Core Problem:**

The State Auditor has identified the same high-risk issues for **18 consecutive years** without resolution. The Department of Technology's oversight of IT projects has been designated high-risk since May 2007. Billions of taxpayer dollars are lost annually to fraud, failed IT projects, and leadership that lacks the technical competence to evaluate decisions, assess risks, or hold subordinates accountable.

**Evidence of Failure (December 2025):**

| Issue | Cost | Duration | Source |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| EDD Fraud | $500M+/year | Ongoing | State Auditor 2025-601 |
| EDD Improper Payments | $1.5B | 2023-2024 | State Auditor 2025-601 |
| FI$Cal Project | $1.06B+ spent | 20 years, incomplete | State Auditor 2024-039 |
| CDT IT Oversight | Unknown billions | 18 years high-risk | State Auditor 2025-601 |
| Information Security | Data breach risk | 12 years high-risk | State Auditor 2025-601 |

The root cause: **accountability theater**—multiple oversight bodies exist but none have enforcement power, and no technical competence requirements exist for the executives responsible for technology decisions.

### 1.2 Relationship to E3 Operational Model

The [E3 Operational Model](governance-model.md) and the Technical Executive Assignment framework are complementary:

| E3 Operational Model | Executive Accountability (TEA) |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Creates NEW positions | Establishes qualification requirements for EXISTING positions |
| Defines responsibilities and authority | Defines competence verification and performance baselines |
| E3 Undersecretaries, Chief Deputy Directors | CIOs, CISOs, CDOs, CTOs |
| Focus: Execution accountability | Focus: Technical competence |

**Integration Point:** E3 positions with technology oversight responsibilities—such as E3 Undersecretary for Technology or E3 Chief Deputy Director for IT—should meet Technical Executive Assignment qualification requirements. This ensures the new governance structure is staffed by leaders with verified technical competence.

### 1.3 Document Scope

This document addresses:

1. **Qualification Requirements** — Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) classification for IT leadership
2. **Performance Baselines** — Measurable accountability for executive outcomes
3. **Audit Enforcement** — Giving oversight bodies authority beyond recommendations
4. **Transition Protection** — Continuity mechanisms for multi-year initiatives
5. **Constitutional Reform** — Permanent structural changes for sustained accountability

**Implementation Resources:**

Ready-to-use materials for stakeholder engagement and implementation are available in [Appendix D](#appendix-d-implementation-toolkit), including:
- Draft Executive Order language
- GovOps/CalHR briefing materials
- Cabinet-level one-pager
- Interactive presentation

## 2. Problem Analysis

> **Section Summary:** This section documents the quantified harm from executive accountability failures, analyzes root causes, and explains why existing oversight mechanisms have failed.

### 2.1 Quantified Taxpayer Harm

**Verified December 2025 — All figures from California State Auditor reports:**

| Agency/Issue | Annual/Total Cost | Duration | Direct Quote |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| **EDD Fraud** | $500M+/year | Ongoing | "its estimated rate of fraudulent payments remains above the level it was in 2019, before the pandemic, indicating that the amount of fraud was more than $500 million in 2024 alone" |
| **EDD Improper Payments** | $1.5B total | 2023-2024 | "its estimated amount of improper payments totaling approximately $1.5 billion over these two years" |
| **CalFresh Error Risk** | $2.5B/year potential | Pending 2028 | "This cost, which could be as much as $2.5 billion in federal fiscal year 2028, is based on California's payment error rate" |
| **FI$Cal** | $1.06B+ spent | 20 years | State Auditor 2024-039: Project initiated 2005, still incomplete |
| **CDT IT Oversight** | Unknown billions | 18 years | "The State Auditor first designated CDT's oversight of IT projects as a high-risk issue in May 2007" |
| **Information Security** | Data breach risk to 40M residents | 12 years | "The State Auditor first identified information security as a high-risk issue in September 2013" |

**Conservative Total: $3B+ in documented losses over the past two years alone.**

### 2.2 Root Cause: No Technical Competence Requirements

The appointment chain for technical executive positions has no technical validation at any level:

```
Governor ──► Agency Secretary ──► CIO/CISO/CDO/CTO
(Political)    (Political)         (No competence test)
```

**CalHR CEA Manual — Current Minimum Qualifications:**

Per the Career Executive Assignment requirements, minimum qualifications are generic management abilities:

> "(a) Knowledge of the organization and functions of California State Government including the organization and practices of the Legislature and the Executive Branch; principles, practices, and trends of public administration, organization, and management..."

**Technical Exception Gap:**

Government Code §19889 creates technical qualification exceptions for positions requiring licensure as a physician, attorney, engineer, or scientist. However, **CIO, CISO, CDO, and CTO positions are NOT included** in this technical exception. No professional licensure or certification is required for IT executive appointments.

**October 2025 Incident — Cybersecurity Leadership:**

California's Cybersecurity Integration Center Commander, Edward Bómbita, was terminated after raising concerns about unqualified oversight. Per CalMatters (October 10, 2025):

> "Another cybersecurity employee said it is 'completely out of their depth when it comes to cyber. You wouldn't let your plumber perform surgery on you. How does it make any sense for someone who has no basis in the reality of the cyber world to dictate policy?'"

This is not an isolated incident—it reflects a systemic qualification gap.

### 2.3 Accountability Theater

California has five oversight bodies for executive performance. None have enforcement authority:

| Oversight Body | Authority | Limitation |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| **State Auditor** | Investigate, report, recommend | Cannot mandate corrective action |
| **Little Hoover Commission** | Study, recommend | "empowered only to make recommendations rather than enforce compliance" |
| **Legislative Analyst's Office** | Analyze, advise | Provides analysis only |
| **State Personnel Board** | Administer CEA rules | No performance enforcement |
| **SLAA (State Leadership Accountability Act)** | Require self-reporting | Agencies grade themselves |

**Result:** CDT has been on the high-risk list for 18 years. EDD has been on the high-risk list for 3+ years with continuing fraud exceeding $500M annually. Agencies acknowledge recommendations and continue operating unchanged.

### 2.4 Transition Vulnerability

Gubernatorial transitions create structural barriers to modernization:

- **55.3%** of executive appointments made by current Governor
- **Complete Cabinet turnover** every 4-8 years
- **Multi-year projects orphaned** without continuity protections

**Case Study — FI$Cal:**

The Financial Information System for California has spanned multiple governors:
- Initiated: 2005 (Schwarzenegger)
- Continued: 2011-2019 (Brown)
- Ongoing: 2019-present (Newsom)
- Original estimate: $617M (2012)
- Current spending: $1.06B+
- Status: Still incomplete after 20 years

Without transition protections, every administration change risks resetting multi-year initiatives.

## 3. Legal and Constitutional Framework

> **Section Summary:** This section documents the current legal structure for executive employment, identifies the qualification gap in existing law, and explains why oversight bodies lack enforcement power.

### 3.1 Current Employment Structure

California's three-tier executive employment system:

| Tier | Description | Legal Basis | Protection Level |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Permanent Civil Service** | Merit-based, competitive examination | CA Constitution Art. VII | High (removal for cause only) |
| **Career Executive Assignment (CEA)** | At-will executives with some protections | Gov. Code §19889-19889.4 | Medium (at-will but procedural rights) |
| **Exempt Positions** | Political appointees at Governor's pleasure | CA Constitution Art. VII, §4 | Low (serve at will) |

CIO, CISO, CDO, and CTO positions typically fall under CEA or Exempt classifications—both of which lack technical competence requirements.

### 3.2 CEA Qualification Gap

**Current CEA Minimum Qualifications (Cal. Code Regs. Title 2, §548):**

CEA positions require only general management knowledge:
- Knowledge of state government organization
- Knowledge of public administration principles
- Ability to analyze problems and recommend solutions
- Ability to establish and maintain working relationships

**Existing Technical Exceptions (Gov. Code §19889):**

Technical qualifications are permitted for positions requiring:
- Licensure as a physician
- Licensure as an attorney
- Licensure as an engineer
- Licensure as a scientist

**The Gap:** Information technology executives are not included in this technical exception, despite managing billions in technology spending and protecting data on 40 million Californians.

### 3.3 Oversight Bodies Without Enforcement

**State Auditor (Gov. Code §8543-8548):**
- Authority to conduct audits and investigations
- Can report findings to Legislature and Governor
- **Cannot** mandate corrective action or impose consequences

**State Leadership Accountability Act (Gov. Code §13400-13407):**
- Requires agencies to maintain internal control systems
- Agencies self-certify compliance annually
- **No independent verification** or enforcement mechanism

**Little Hoover Commission (Gov. Code §8501-8521):**
- Conducts studies and makes recommendations
- Explicitly advisory: "empowered only to make recommendations"
- **Cannot** require implementation

---

## 4. Technical Executive Assignment (TEA)

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes the Technical Executive Assignment classification, defines covered positions, qualification pathways, and integration with E3 positions.

### 4.1 Classification Overview

The Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) creates a subcategory of Career Executive Assignment specifically for technology leadership roles, with domain-specific qualification requirements.

**Legal Basis:**
- Extends existing technical exception logic from Gov. Code §19889
- Implemented initially via Executive Order, later codified in statute
- Administered by CalHR in coordination with CDT

**Core Principle:**

> We require doctors to be licensed. Attorneys to pass the bar. Engineers to be certified. Technical Executive Assignment extends this logic to IT leadership positions where technical competence is equally critical.

For draft Executive Order language implementing TEA, see [Appendix D.1: Executive Order Draft](../appendices/executive-order-tea.md).

### 4.2 Covered Positions

| Position Type | Scope | Rationale |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Chief Information Officer | State CIO and all agency CIOs | Technology strategy and delivery |
| Chief Information Security Officer | State CISO and all agency CISOs | Cybersecurity and risk management |
| Chief Data Officer | State CDO and all agency CDOs | Data governance and analytics |
| Chief Technology Officer | All CTOs | Technical architecture and standards |
| IT Director-level | Positions with direct IT delivery responsibility | Project and program execution |

**Designation Authority:** Government Operations Agency may designate additional positions as Covered Positions based on technical oversight responsibilities.

### 4.3 Qualification Pathways

TEA provides three pathways to demonstrate Technical Competence, ensuring flexibility while maintaining rigor:

#### Pathway 1: Professional Certification

The individual holds current professional certifications recognized by CalHR:

| Position Type | Recognized Certifications |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Security roles | CISSP, CISM, CISA, or equivalent |
| IT Management | PMP, TOGAF, ITIL Expert, or equivalent |
| Data roles | CDMP, or equivalent |

#### Pathway 2: Demonstrated Experience

The individual demonstrates:
- At least **10 years** of progressively responsible technical leadership experience
- **Documented outcomes** (projects delivered, teams managed, budgets overseen)
- **References** from at least two technical peers or supervisors

#### Pathway 3: Independent Technical Panel

A three-member panel evaluates the candidate:

| Member | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Panel Member 1 | CalHR representative |
| Panel Member 2 | CDT representative |
| Panel Member 3 | External subject matter expert |

The panel conducts a structured technical interview and issues a written recommendation within 30 days. The recommendation becomes part of the public record.

**Why Three Pathways:**
- Certification validates formal knowledge but may exclude experienced practitioners
- Experience pathway captures leaders who predate modern certifications
- Panel review accommodates non-traditional paths (military cyber operators, startup CTOs, career changers)

### 4.4 Appointing Authority Requirements

Before appointing an individual to a Covered Position, the Appointing Authority (Secretary, Undersecretary, Director) must:

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Verify qualification** | Confirm candidate has met one of the three pathways |
| **Document assessment** | Create written record of technical qualification evaluation |
| **Certify understanding** | Attest in writing that they understand the position's technical scope |

**For positions exceeding $200K annual salary:**
- Obtain independent technical review before appointment
- Review may be conducted by CDT, Independent Technical Panel, or GovOps-designated entity

**Audit Trail:**
- All documentation maintained by CalHR
- Subject to audit by California State Auditor
- Supports transparency and accountability

### 4.5 Integration with E3 Positions

E3 positions created under the [Governance Model](governance-model.md) with technology oversight responsibilities should meet TEA requirements:

| E3 Position | TEA Requirement |
|-------------|-----------------|
| E3 Undersecretary with technology portfolio | Pathway 2 or 3 (experience or panel) |
| E3 Chief Deputy Director for IT | Any pathway |
| TMO Director | Pathway 2 or 3 |

This integration ensures the E3 governance structure is staffed by leaders who can evaluate technical decisions, assess risks, and hold subordinates accountable for technical outcomes.

| **Performance Standards** | Annual objectives and evaluation requirements |
| **Transparency** | Public dashboard and reporting |
| **Pilot** | CDT as initial implementation agency |

#### B. CalHR Directive: Executive Performance Baselines

Creates measurable accountability for executive performance:

- Annual performance objectives (3-5 measurable goals) for all CEA/Exempt positions
- Quarterly progress reporting
- Public dashboard of aggregate executive performance
- Salary increases tied to documented outcomes
- Duty statements include minimum technical competencies and performance metrics

#### C. SLAA Enhancement

Adds enforcement mechanisms to self-reporting framework:

| Escalation Trigger | Consequence |
|-------------------|-------------|
