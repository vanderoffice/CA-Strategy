**Statewide Advisory Services:**

Senior Fellows are available to provide advisory support to any state department or agency:

- **Consultation requests:** Departments may request Senior Fellow expertise through ODI
- **Advisory engagements:** Short-term advisory support (hours to days) on specific modernization challenges
- **Expert matching:** ODI maintains a directory of Senior Fellow expertise areas to match advisors with departmental needs
- **No-cost consultation:** Initial advisory consultations provided at no cost to requesting departments
- **Extended engagements:** Longer advisory relationships arranged through interagency agreements or TMO coordination

**Sustainability Model:**

With 6-month cohorts starting every 4 months, California builds sustained Senior Fellow capacity:

- **After 12 months:** 40 Senior Fellows (2 cohorts graduated)
- **After 18 months:** 60 Senior Fellows (3 cohorts graduated)
- **After 24 months:** 80 Senior Fellows (4 cohorts graduated)
- **After 36 months:** 120+ Senior Fellows (6+ cohorts graduated)

This creates a self-sustaining pipeline that compounds over time, with Senior Fellows deployed throughout state government driving continuous modernization.

### 5.3 Executive Duty Statement Integration

**Positioning Fellowship as Desired Qualification:**

As executive positions open or are reclassified, include fellowship participation as "desirable" or "highly valued" qualification.

**Sample Duty Statement Language:**

> **Desirable Qualifications:**
> Completion of Governor's Innovation Fellowship (Senior Fellow status) or equivalent executive leadership development program focused on organizational modernization, cross-functional collaboration, and enterprise perspective. Senior Fellows bring demonstrated understanding of state government systems, authentic relationships across multiple departments, hands-on experience with change management in complex organizations, and commitment to evidence-based modernization.

**Implementation Phases:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Pilot in 10-15 senior positions
- Chief Data Officer and modernization officer roles
- Deputy secretary roles in priority agencies
- Director positions in high-impact departments

**Phase 2 (Months 6-12):** Expand to 20-30 positions
- Positions where enterprise perspective critical
- Cross-functional roles requiring collaboration
- Innovation and transformation leadership roles

**Phase 3 (Years 2-3):** Standardize across 40-50+ executive-level roles
- Routine inclusion in executive position duty statements
- Integration into succession planning
- Recognition as premier leadership development pathway

**Benefits:**

**For Senior Fellows:**
- Competitive advantage in advancement
- Clear career pathway to executive roles
- Recognition of skills and experience
- Return on investment in Fellowship participation

**For State:**
- Leaders with enterprise perspective (not siloed)
- Established relationships enabling collaboration

- Continuity of modernization efforts
- Culture of innovation and continuous improvement

### 5.4 Data Governance Teams (Permanent State Staff)

> **See also:** [Independent Office of State Data Governance](data-governance.md) for governance structure, and [Data Sharing Agreement Templates](data-governance.md#34-data-sharing-agreement-templates) for standardized agreements these teams will execute.

**Purpose:** Provide sustainable civil service capacity to support modernization and sustain innovations after Fellows graduate. These teams are foundational to AI readiness—preparing the high-quality data AI needs and establishing oversight for responsible use.

**Blended Expertise Model:**

Effective data governance requires combining domain expertise with technical data skills:

**Domain Specialists:**
- Scientists, engineers, and subject matter experts (existing classifications)
- Understand what data means, where it comes from, regulatory requirements
- Apply professional judgment to data quality and interpretation
- Ensure data governance aligns with programmatic needs

**Data Specialists:**
- Data architects, engineers, and analysts
- Build systems, pipelines, and integration infrastructure
- Implement technical data quality controls
- Enable self-service analytics and reporting

**Why Both Are Essential:**
- Domain specialists alone lack technical skills to implement solutions
- Data specialists alone lack context to make correct decisions about data
- Combined expertise delivers effective data governance

**Why Science and Engineering Classifications:**

| Benefit | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Higher Compensation** | Professional classifications pay 20-30% more, essential for recruiting technical talent |
| **Critical Thinking** | Scientists/engineers trained in analytical thinking, experimentation, validation |
| **Domain Expertise** | Many datasets require specialized knowledge (environmental, health, public safety) |
| **Classification Alignment** | Leverages existing CA infrastructure, reduces HR complexity |
| **Professional Accountability** | Supervisory roles provide "responsible charge" over data quality; licensure (PE/PG) preferred for some roles |

**Deployment Strategy:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-12): Pilot Deployment**
- 3-5 pilot departments selected based on Readiness Assessment
- Full team deployment with intensive support from TMO and ODI
- Establish team operating models and best practices
- Document lessons learned for broader rollout

**Phase 2 (Months 13-24): Scaling**
- 15-20 departments receive data governance teams
- Leverage pilot learnings and templates
- Communities of Practice connecting teams across departments
- Shared services (e.g., data infrastructure, training) reducing duplication

**Phase 3 (Months 25-36): Statewide Deployment**
- Complete deployment to 30 departments with dedicated teams
- Establish 6-8 regional data governance hubs serving remaining departments
- Mature operating model and standards
- Self-sustaining communities supporting each other
- Integration with Office of State Data Governance standards

**Deployment Model:**

| Tier | Departments | Model | Staffing |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Tier 1-2** (Dedicated Teams) | 30 largest departments (~85% of IT spend) | Full 13-15 FTE data governance team | 390-450 positions |
| **Tier 3-4** (Shared Services) | 140 smaller departments | Regional hub support + TMO technical assistance | 6-8 hubs × 8-10 FTE = 48-80 positions |
| **Total** | 170 departments | Hybrid model | **438-530 positions** |

**Regional Hub Structure:**
- 6-8 hubs geographically distributed (Northern CA, Bay Area, Central Valley, Greater LA, etc.)
- Each hub serves 15-25 smaller departments
- Hub services: data quality consulting, standards implementation, training, technical assistance
- Departments retain ownership; hubs provide expertise and surge capacity

**Expected Impact:**
- 95%+ data quality for critical datasets (up from 60-70% baseline)
- 80% reduction in data sharing negotiation time (from 12-18 months to 4-8 weeks for standard scenarios using templates)
- 50%+ increase in data-driven decision making (measured by analytics tool usage)
- 438-530 permanent civil service positions created (390-450 in dedicated teams, 48-80 in regional hubs)
- Sustainable capacity independent of Fellowship program or external consultants
