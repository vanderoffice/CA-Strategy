*For detailed curriculum, training modules, and deliverable requirements, see [Appendix B.2: Fellowship Program Curriculum](../appendices/operational-guides.md#b2-fellowship-program-curriculum).*

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Actionable recommendations for enterprise-wide improvements
- Some initiatives directly transition to Breakthrough Fund projects
- Fellows gain experience leading complex, cross-agency initiatives; graduates become Senior Fellows
- Graduates with technical backgrounds develop toward TEA qualification for future CIO/CISO/CDO/CTO roles

### 5.2 Post-Fellowship Engagement

Upon graduation, Fellows become **Senior Fellows** and join a permanent network of modernization leaders.

**On-Call Subject Matter Expert Network:**

**Structure:**
- All Senior Fellows remain available to ODI for ongoing modernization work
- 5-10 hours/month average time commitment (flexible based on project needs)
- Paid as consulting engagement or detail from home agency
- Quarterly meetings of SME network for knowledge sharing

**Activation:**
- Specific initiatives needing expertise (e.g., Senior Fellow led similar project)
- Departmental requests for support (e.g., Senior Fellow embedded in that department)
- Breakthrough Fund project support
- Capacity augmentation during peak periods

**Emergency Response Capacity:**

**Roster:**
- Emergency response roster of Senior Fellows from past 3-5 years
- Categorized by expertise (IT systems, data, cybersecurity, operations, communications)
- Pre-authorized for rapid activation
- **Voluntary participation:** Senior Fellows may opt out of the emergency roster at any time based on personal circumstances, workload, or other factors

**Activation Scenarios:**
- IT system failures requiring immediate response
- Cybersecurity incidents needing surge capacity
- Natural disaster response coordination
- Pandemic or public health emergency
- Any operational crisis requiring expert support

**Response Protocol:**
- Rapid activation (24-48 hours notice)
- 3-5 Senior Fellows assembled based on relevant expertise and availability
- Intensive engagement for duration of crisis (typically 2-6 weeks)
- Full-time detail from home agency or emergency contract
- After-action documentation and lessons learned

**Modernization Advisory Network:**

**Selection:**

- Input on Fellowship curriculum and improvements
- Mentoring of current Fellows

**Statewide Advisory Services:**

Senior Fellows are available to provide advisory support to any state department or agency:

- **Consultation requests:** Departments may request Senior Fellow expertise through ODI
- **Advisory engagements:** Short-term advisory support (hours to days) on specific modernization challenges
- **Expert matching:** ODI maintains a directory of Senior Fellow expertise areas to match advisors with departmental needs
- **No-cost consultation:** Initial advisory consultations provided at no cost to requesting departments
- **Extended engagements:** Longer advisory relationships arranged through interagency agreements or TMO coordination

**Sustainability Model:**

With 6-month cohorts starting every 4 months, California builds sustained Senior Fellow capacity:

- **After 12 months:** 40 Senior Fellows (2 cohorts graduated)
- **After 18 months:** 60 Senior Fellows (3 cohorts graduated)
- **After 24 months:** 80 Senior Fellows (4 cohorts graduated)
- **After 36 months:** 120+ Senior Fellows (6+ cohorts graduated)

This creates a self-sustaining pipeline that compounds over time, with Senior Fellows deployed throughout state government driving continuous modernization.

### 5.3 Fellowship-to-Technical Executive Pathway

> **See also:** [Executive Accountability](executive-accountability.md) for complete TEA framework and qualification pathways.

**Purpose:**
The Governor's Innovation Fellowship provides a structured pathway for emerging leaders to develop toward Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) qualification. Fellows with technical backgrounds who complete the program gain experience and credentials that count toward TEA eligibility.

**How Fellowship Supports TEA Qualification:**

| TEA Pathway | How Fellowship Contributes |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Professional Certification** | Fellowship provides protected time and resources for certification preparation; CalAcademy offers certification prep courses |
| **Demonstrated Experience** | 6-month project ownership with documented outcomes; cross-agency leadership experience; enterprise perspective |
| **Independent Technical Panel** | Fellows build relationships with CDT, CalHR, and external experts who may serve on TEA panels; documented outcomes strengthen panel applications |

**Fellowship-to-TEA Timeline:**

```
Year 1: Fellowship Participation
├── Complete 6-month cohort
├── Pursue relevant certifications (if certification pathway)
├── Document project outcomes for portfolio
└── Graduate as Senior Fellow

Years 2-5: Experience Building
├── Continue in technical leadership role (state or private sector)
├── Accumulate documented outcomes
├── Maintain Senior Fellow network engagement
└── Build toward 10-year experience threshold (if experience pathway)

Year 5+: TEA-Eligible Positions
├── Apply for CIO, CISO, CDO, CTO roles
├── Present Fellowship outcomes as part of qualification package
└── Leverage Senior Fellow network for references and mentorship
```

**Senior Fellows in TEA Positions:**

As the Fellowship program matures, Senior Fellows will increasingly fill TEA-qualified positions:

- **Year 3:** First Senior Fellows with 10+ years prior experience become TEA-eligible
- **Year 5:** Senior Fellows who pursued certification pathway become eligible
- **Year 8+:** Original cohorts reach 10-year experience threshold

**Benefits of Fellowship-to-TEA Pathway:**

| For the State | For the Fellow |
|---------------|----------------|
| Pipeline of TEA-qualified candidates with enterprise perspective | Clear career pathway to technical executive roles |
| Leaders who understand California government from the inside | Recognition of Fellowship investment |
| Built-in network reducing onboarding time | Access to Senior Fellow network for ongoing support |
| Continuity of modernization leadership | Competitive advantage in executive hiring |

### 5.4 Executive Duty Statement Integration

**Positioning Fellowship as Desired Qualification:**

As executive positions open or are reclassified, include fellowship participation as "desirable" or "highly valued" qualification.

**Sample Duty Statement Language:**

> **Desirable Qualifications:**
> Completion of Governor's Innovation Fellowship (Senior Fellow status) or equivalent executive leadership development program focused on organizational modernization, cross-functional collaboration, and enterprise perspective. Senior Fellows bring demonstrated understanding of state government systems, authentic relationships across multiple departments, hands-on experience with change management in complex organizations, and commitment to evidence-based modernization.

**TEA-Covered Position Integration:**

For positions requiring Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) qualification, duty statements include both TEA requirements and Fellowship recognition:

> **Minimum Qualifications:**
> Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) qualification through professional certification, demonstrated experience (10+ years technical leadership), or Independent Technical Panel recommendation. See [Executive Accountability](executive-accountability.md) for details.
>
> **Desirable Qualifications:**
> Governor's Innovation Fellowship (Senior Fellow status); experience with California enterprise systems; demonstrated cross-agency collaboration.

**Implementation Phases:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Pilot in 10-15 senior positions
- Chief Data Officer and modernization officer roles
- Deputy secretary roles in priority agencies
- Director positions in high-impact departments

**Phase 2 (Months 6-12):** Expand to 20-30 positions
- Positions where enterprise perspective critical
- Cross-functional roles requiring collaboration
- Innovation and transformation leadership roles

**Phase 3 (Years 2-3):** Standardize across 40-50+ executive-level roles
- Routine inclusion in executive position duty statements
- Integration into succession planning
- Recognition as premier leadership development pathway
- Alignment with TEA requirements for technical positions

**Benefits:**

**For Senior Fellows:**
- Competitive advantage in advancement
- Clear career pathway to executive roles
- Recognition of skills and experience
- Return on investment in Fellowship participation

**For State:**
- Leaders with enterprise perspective (not siloed)
- Established relationships enabling collaboration
- Reduced onboarding time (already know state government)
- Continuity of modernization efforts
- Culture of innovation and continuous improvement
- Pipeline of TEA-qualified candidates for technical executive roles

### 5.5 Data Governance Teams (Permanent State Staff)

> **See also:** [Independent Office of State Data Governance](data-governance.md) for governance structure, and [Data Sharing Agreement Templates](data-governance.md#34-data-sharing-agreement-templates) for standardized agreements these teams will execute.

**Purpose:** Provide sustainable civil service capacity to support modernization and sustain innovations after Fellows graduate. These teams are foundational to AI readiness—preparing the high-quality data AI needs and establishing oversight for responsible use.

**Blended Expertise Model:**

Effective data governance requires combining domain expertise with technical data skills:

**Domain Specialists:**
- Scientists, engineers, and subject matter experts (existing classifications)
- Understand what data means, where it comes from, regulatory requirements
- Apply professional judgment to data quality and interpretation
- Ensure data governance aligns with programmatic needs

**Data Specialists:**
- Data architects, engineers, and analysts
- Build systems, pipelines, and integration infrastructure
- Implement technical data quality controls
- Enable self-service analytics and reporting

**Why Both Are Essential:**
- Domain specialists alone lack technical skills to implement solutions
- Data specialists alone lack context to make correct decisions about data
- Combined expertise delivers effective data governance

**Why Science and Engineering Classifications:**

| Benefit | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Higher Compensation** | Professional classifications pay 20-30% more, essential for recruiting technical talent |
| **Critical Thinking** | Scientists/engineers trained in analytical thinking, experimentation, validation |
| **Domain Expertise** | Many datasets require specialized knowledge (environmental, health, public safety) |
| **Classification Alignment** | Leverages existing CA infrastructure, reduces HR complexity |
| **Professional Accountability** | Supervisory roles provide "responsible charge" over data quality; licensure (PE/PG) preferred for some roles |

---

### 5.5.1 Leveraging Existing Classifications for Digital Leadership

> **Note:** This section addresses competitive compensation and classification pathways for all digital leadership roles—not just AI. For TEA qualification requirements, see [Executive Accountability](executive-accountability.md).

**The Challenge:**

State technical executives (CIO, CISO, CDO, CTO) compete for talent against private sector roles paying 30-40% more. According to [Federal News Network](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/pay/2024/11/federal-pay-rates-are-falling-nearly-25-short-of-the-private-sector/), government pay falls approximately 25% below private sector for comparable positions—a gap exceeding 20% since 2007. In California's competitive tech market, state CIOs average ~$173K while private sector CIOs average $264K.

Additionally, individual "Hire Above Minimum" (HAM) rates were **eliminated in October 2024** by CalHR to prevent gender pay gaps. This creates a constraint that requires alternative pathways to competitive compensation.

**CalHR's 6 IT Domains (Scope of Digital Leadership):**

The 2018 IT Classification Consolidation established [6 IT domains](https://www.calhr.ca.gov/about-calhr/divisions-programs/personnel-management/class-specifications/information-technology-class-consolidation/) replacing 36 outdated classifications with a 9-class series:

| Domain | Description | Leadership Role Examples |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Business Technology Management** | IT portfolio, strategy, digital UX, procurement | CIO, CDO, Digital Services Director |
| **Software Engineering** | Application development, architecture | Chief Architect, Engineering Director |
| **System Engineering** | Infrastructure, cloud, database, network | CTO, Infrastructure Director |
| **Information Security Engineering** | Cybersecurity, risk management | CISO, Security Director |
| **IT Project Management** | Delivery, governance | PMO Director, Delivery Lead |
| **Client Services** | End-user support, training | Service Delivery Director |

**The Solution—Three Pathways to Competitive Compensation:**

**Pathway 1: CEA Restricted Zone (Executive Roles)**

For TEA positions requiring licensed engineer or scientist credentials, departments can pay above the standard $256K CEA cap:

| Classification | Salary Range | Access Requirement |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| CEA Level A/B/C | $124K-$256K annually | Standard executive appointment |
| **CEA Restricted Zone** | **>$256K** | Position requires licensed engineer, scientist, physician, or attorney credentials; valid CEA Delegation Agreement |

**How to Access Restricted Zone:**
1. Ensure TEA position duty statement requires "technical/professional responsibility" equivalent to licensed engineer/scientist
2. Confirm department has valid, signed CEA Delegation Agreement with CalHR
3. Document that position carries same technical responsibility as licensed roles
4. CalHR approves salary above Level C maximum

**Source:** [CalHR CEA Salaries](https://www.calhr.ca.gov/about-calhr/divisions-programs/personnel-management/cea-job-info/cea-salaries/)

**Pathway 2: Classification-Level HAM (Technical Specialists)**

For IT Specialist III, IT Manager, and similar classifications experiencing recruitment difficulty:

| Current Classification | Salary Range | HAM Pathway |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------|
| IT Specialist III | $90K-$148K | Submit Employee Compensation Request |
| IT Manager I | $100K-$167K | Demonstrate recruitment difficulty |
| IT Manager II | $113K-$179K | CalHR adds to Pay Scales Section 5 |
| IT Supervisor II | $74K-$121K | Classification-level (not individual) |

**October 2024 HAM Policy Change:**
- ❌ Individual HAMs eliminated (to prevent gender pay gaps)
- ✅ Classification-level HAMs still available via [Employee Compensation Request](https://hrmanual.calhr.ca.gov/Home/ManualItem/1/1707)
- ✅ CalHR reviews annually and updates Pay Scales Section 5

**How to Request Classification-Level HAM:**
1. Compile data showing recruitment difficulty (vacancy rates, time-to-fill, failed recruitments)
2. Document market salary comparisons for classification
3. Submit Employee Compensation Request to CalHR
4. CalHR Employee Compensation Unit: 916-322-5193 / employeecomp@calhr.ca.gov

**Pathway 3: Research Scientist/Engineer Series (Analytical Roles)**

For data governance, AI/ML, and analytical leadership positions:

| Classification | [CalHR Series](https://www.calhr.ca.gov/state-hr-professionals/pages/5729.aspx) | Salary Range | Best For |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Research Data Specialist I | 5729 | $62K-$88K | Entry-level data governance, model validation |
| Research Data Specialist II | 5729 | $77K-$110K | Experienced data governance, analytics |
| Research Data Manager | 5729 | $105K-$119K | Data governance leadership |
| Research Scientist | [5576](https://www.calhr.ca.gov/state-hr-professionals/Pages/5576.aspx) | Varies by specialty | Domain-specific AI/ML, scientific integrity |

**Why Research Series for Digital Leadership:**
- **Immediate availability:** No 6-18 month classification study required
- **Analytical training required:** Statistics, research methods, critical thinking
- **Competitive pay:** Already compensates for specialized skills
- **Civil service protections:** Career stability for technical talent
- **Union-recognized:** Existing SEIU bargaining unit relationships

**Implementation Pathway for Digital Leadership Classifications:**

| Phase | Timeline | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Months 1-3 | Map TEA positions to appropriate classification pathway; identify candidates for restricted zone |
| 2 | Months 3-6 | For CEA positions: Update duty statements to reference engineer/scientist credentials; confirm delegation agreements |
| 3 | Months 6-12 | For IT positions: Compile recruitment difficulty data; submit classification-level HAM requests |
| 4 | Ongoing | Coordinate with CalHR Employee Compensation Unit; meet and confer with SEIU/PECG on duty statement changes |
| 5 | Pilot | Test pathways in 2-3 departments with active TEA recruitment; document outcomes |

**Target:** 100% of data governance team members trained in foundational competencies by Year 2

### 5.7 Labor Relations

Successful modernization requires partnership with labor organizations representing state employees. Key principles include:

- **No Involuntary Separations:** Efficiency gains redirect staff to higher-value work, not unemployment
- **Early Engagement:** Unions consulted before, not after, modernization decisions
- **Upskilling Priority:** Training programs prepare workers for evolving roles
- **Classification Coordination:** New data governance positions developed in coordination with CalHR and relevant bargaining units

**TEA and Executive Classifications:**
The Technical Executive Assignment (TEA) framework applies only to Career Executive Assignments and exempt positions—not to civil service classifications or represented employees. Labor relations for TEA focus on:
- Ensuring clear boundaries between TEA-covered executive roles and represented positions
- Training programs that help represented employees develop toward future executive roles
- No scope creep of executive requirements into civil service classifications

For comprehensive guidance on union engagement, workforce transitions, and training coordination, see [Appendix B.4: Labor Relations Strategy](../appendices/operational-guides.md#b4-labor-relations-strategy).
