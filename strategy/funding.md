## 6. The California Breakthrough Modernization Fund

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes a $100M fund governed by portfolio management principles with a sustainability mechanism that reinvests 25% of realized savings. The fund's portfolio approach is particularly important as AI capabilities rapidly evolve—dedicated funding enables California to adopt AI opportunities as they mature rather than waiting for annual budget cycles.

This proposal recommends establishing a Breakthrough Modernization Fund that would apply proven private sector and venture capital investment patterns—adapted for public sector accountability requirements. Like a VC portfolio, the fund would accept that not all investments succeed; diversification across risk categories maximizes overall return while limiting exposure to any single failure. Unlike traditional government budgets that treat each project as pass/fail, this portfolio approach would enable the higher-risk, higher-reward initiatives essential for transformational change while maintaining fiscal responsibility through stage-gate oversight and transparent performance measurement.

### 6.1 Fund Purpose and Structure

**Fund Overview:**

The proposed California Breakthrough Modernization Fund (Breakthrough Fund) would capitalize **project investments**—Quick Wins, Strategic Initiatives, and Innovation Ventures—using portfolio management principles. Unlike traditional government budgets that require annual appropriation battles, the Breakthrough Fund would operate with multi-year investment authority enabling rapid response to modernization opportunities.

> **Critical Distinction:** The Breakthrough Fund is for **projects only**, not positions. All operating costs—E3 leadership positions, TMO staff, Fellowship stipends, Data Steward specialists—require separate General Fund appropriation ($23-38M annually). The Fund and operating budget are complementary: the Fund invests in projects; General Fund invests in the people who deliver them.

**Why a Dedicated Fund:**

**Multi-Year Horizon:**
- Modernization projects span 2-5 years; annual budget uncertainty disrupts delivery
- Fund provides stable, predictable investment capacity
- Political transitions don't interrupt in-flight initiatives
- Long-term thinking enabled by long-term funding

**Portfolio Approach:**
- Not all investments succeed; portfolio management expects and accounts for failure
- Higher-risk/higher-reward initiatives funded alongside proven approaches
- Cross-subsidy: successful projects generate savings that fund future projects
- Diversified investment reduces catastrophic failure risk

**Speed and Flexibility:**
- Pre-authorized funding for approved project types
- Reduced approval cycles (weeks instead of months)
- Rapid response to opportunities (emerging AI capabilities, new technologies, partnership offers)
- Pilot funding available without annual budget process
- Ability to move quickly as AI tools mature—critical given the pace of AI advancement

**Accountability:**
- Clear success metrics and public reporting
- Performance-based continuation (projects that fail don't get refunded)
- Transparency to Legislature, press, and public
- Private sector co-investment creates external accountability

### 6.1.1 Private Sector Partnership Framework

> **Guiding Principle:** Private sector partnership enhances accountability and brings expertise, but must preserve public control and transparency. Partners contribute capital and knowledge; they do not gain procurement preference.

#### Structure and Capitalization

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| State appropriation | $50M |
| Private sector | $50M |
| **Total** | **$100M** |

**Partnership Categories:**

| Category | Contribution | Governance Role | Restrictions |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Philanthropic | Grant capital | Advisory only | Standard disclosure |
| Civic Tech | In-kind expertise | Advisory; may join Committee | Cannot bid on projects |
| Corporate | Capital + expertise | Rotating observer | Procurement firewall |
| Federal/Foundation | Grant capital | Per grant terms | Grant compliance |

**Contribution Tiers:** Founding ($5M+), Innovation ($1-5M), Supporting ($250K-1M), In-Kind (equivalent value) — each with corresponding recognition and engagement levels.

#### Ethics and Compliance

To ensure public trust and avoid conflicts of interest:

1. **No Bid Privilege:** Partners receive *no preferential treatment* in any procurement process. Contributing capital does not influence vendor selection.

2. **Recusal Requirements:**
   - Partners must recuse from any Investment Committee discussion involving projects where they might bid
   - Partners cannot serve on evaluation committees for projects they may pursue
   - 12-month cooling-off period: Partners who exit partnership cannot bid on funded projects for 12 months

3. **Transparency:**
   - All partnership agreements publicly posted
   - All contributions disclosed in quarterly reports
   - Investment Committee meeting minutes (with appropriate redactions) published
   - Any perceived conflict flagged and documented with resolution

4. **Structural Separation:** Corporate contributions go to general pool (not earmarked). Partner representatives serve as non-voting observers; voting authority remains with government officials.

#### Partner Benefits and Targets

Why contribute without procurement advantage?

| Partner Type | Value Received |
|--------------|----------------|
| Philanthropic Foundations | Mission alignment; measurable California impact |
| Technology Companies | Public sector commitment; talent pipeline; industry reputation |
| Academic Institutions | Research access; student placement; policy influence |
| Civic Tech Organizations | Scale impact; influence on government practices |

**Target Mix:** Philanthropic ($15M), Civic Tech ($10M in-kind), Corporate ($15M), Federal Grants ($10M)

#### Governance and Risk

**Partnership Director** (within TMO) manages relationships and compliance. Annual reviews assess engagement, contribution status, and renewal.

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Partner expects favor | Explicit terms; recusal; transparency |
| Pay-to-play perception | Philanthropic priority; firewall enforcement |
| Partner exit | Multi-year pledges; diversified base |
| Insufficient interest | Phased approach; state can proceed at $50M |

**Fallback:** If private partnership falls short, state proceeds at smaller scale with $50M appropriation. Partnership positioned as enhancement, not requirement.

### 6.2 Investment Categories

**Category 1: Quick Wins (40% of portfolio)**
- **Investment Range:** $100K-$500K per initiative
- **Timeline:** 1-12 months to completion

- **Examples:** Process automation, digital form conversion, API wrappers for legacy systems, Claude Code deployment to IT teams
- **Risk Profile:** Low risk, moderate return
- **Success Target:** 80%+ success rate

**Quick Win Success Criteria:** A Quick Win is "successful" when it achieves any measurable improvement verified within 12 months:
- **Time savings:** Reduced processing time (e.g., 40% faster)
- **Cost reduction:** Lower operating costs or FTE reallocation
- **Error reduction:** Fewer mistakes, rework, or complaints
- **User adoption:** Staff or citizens actively using the new capability
- **Failure acknowledgment:** ~20% of Quick Wins may not deliver expected value; this is acceptable risk. Document lessons learned and move on.

**Category 2: Strategic Initiatives (40% of portfolio)**
- **Investment Range:** $500K-$5M per initiative
- **Timeline:** 12-24 months to completion
- **Purpose:** Significant modernization with substantial impact

**Category 3: Innovation Ventures (20% of portfolio)**
- **Investment Range:** $100K-$1M per initiative
- **Timeline:** 12-36 months (research and development phases)
- **Purpose:** Explore emerging technologies and approaches, particularly AI applications that can transform service delivery
- **Examples:** AI-powered eligibility determination, intelligent document processing, predictive analytics for fraud detection, AI assistants for citizen services, automated case routing and triage
- **Risk Profile:** High risk, potentially transformative return
- **Success Target:** 30%+ success rate (with high impact from successes)
- **AI Governance Requirement:** All AI-related investments must comply with Independent Office AI standards for human oversight, bias testing, and transparency

### 6.2.1 Investment in Workforce Capability

> **Key Insight:** Traditional modernization funds technology; California's fund also builds the workforce to sustain it.

The Breakthrough Fund invests not just in technology, but in the people who use it. Three investment types build sustainable capability:

**1. AI Productivity Tool Deployment (Quick Wins — $100K-$500K)**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Tool** | Claude Code Enterprise (~$20/user/month) |
| **Target Users** | IT developers, analysts, policy staff |
| **Expected Impact** | 26-55% productivity improvement |
| **Rollout** | 8-9 month phased deployment per [Claude Code Deployment Plan](../toolkit/claude-code-deployment/) |
| **Technical Controls** | OpenTelemetry logging to state SIEM, SSO integration, permission restrictions |

**Example Investment:**
- 500 developers × $240/year = $120K annually
- With 40% productivity gain = equivalent of 200 additional developers
- ROI: ~$15M value from $120K investment (at $75K/developer cost)

**2. Upskilling Programs (Strategic — $500K-$2M)**

| Program | Investment | ROI |
|---------|------------|-----|
| CalAcademy AI literacy (knowledge workers) | $500K-$1M | 43% return per [Microsoft/ROI Institute](https://wwps.microsoft.com/blog/roi-results-ps-skilling-part3) |
| Data Steward certification (department trainers) | $200K-$400K | 80% reduction in data governance costs |
| TEA certification prep (future technical executives) | $100K-$200K | Pipeline of qualified CIO/CISO/CDO/CTO candidates |

**3. In-House Solution Development (Strategic/Venture — $1M-$5M)**

| Approach | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Build internal capabilities vs. perpetual vendor contracts | Long-term cost avoidance |
| Citizen developer programs (low-code platforms) | Democratized automation |
| Internal AI/ML expertise using Claude Code | Reduced consultant dependence |

**Why This Matters:**

This creates a virtuous cycle:
1. Trained workers + AI tools = more productive teams
2. More productive teams = better project outcomes
3. Better outcomes = more savings
4. More savings = more funding for training

Claude Code is the specific tool—already vetted for California compliance (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001:2022, data NOT used for training). See [Talent Development](talent-development.md) for the full California Digital Capability Model.

### 6.3 Governance and Oversight

**Investment Committee:**

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| GovOps Secretary (Chair) | Final investment approval |
| TMO Director | Portfolio management, performance tracking |
| ODI Director | Innovation and methodology guidance |
| CDT Director | Technology architecture and security review |
| Department of Finance Rep | Budget compliance and fiscal oversight |
| Breakthrough Partner Rep (rotating) | Private sector perspective, co-investment decisions |

**Decision Authority:**
- Quick Wins (<$500K): TMO Director with Investment Committee notification
- Strategic Initiatives ($500K-$5M): Investment Committee approval
- Innovation Ventures: Investment Committee approval with technical review

**Investment Criteria:**

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Strategic Alignment | 25% | Alignment with E3 goals, statewide priorities |
| Citizen Impact | 25% | Measurable improvement in service delivery |
| Readiness | 20% | Department Readiness Assessment score, team capability |
| ROI Potential | 15% | Projected savings, efficiency gains |
| Scalability | 15% | Replicability across other departments |

**Stage-Gate Reviews:**
- All investments subject to stage-gate reviews (planning, development, deployment, operations)
- Go/no-go decisions at each gate based on progress and risk assessment
- Underperforming projects redirected or terminated early
- Lessons learned captured regardless of outcome

### 6.4 Sustainability Mechanism

> **The Core Principle:** Every successful project returns a portion of savings to fund future projects. The fund is designed to *catalyze* modernization, not fund it forever.

#### How the Sustainability Mechanism Works

**Simple Example:**

```
1. Fund invests $2M in cloud migration
2. Migration saves $800K annually
3. 25% of savings ($200K/year) returns to fund
4. After 10 years: $2M returned (break-even)
5. Agency keeps $6M in cumulative savings
```

The fund breaks even; the agency gains ongoing savings. This is the model replicated across hundreds of projects.

**Why the Fund Balance Declines Initially:**

| Phase | What's Happening |
|-------|------------------|
| **Years 1-3** | Investments exceed returns (normal for new programs) |
| **Years 4-5** | Returns grow as projects mature and savings accumulate |
| **Years 5-7** | Reinvestment exceeds new investment needs; fund becomes self-sustaining |

This is expected and by design. Early investment builds the portfolio; later savings sustain it.

**Savings Calculation:**
- Projects track baseline costs (before modernization)
- Post-implementation costs measured for 12-24 months
- Verified savings calculated: (Baseline - Post-Implementation) × Duration
- Third-party validation for savings above $1M

**Reinvestment Rate:** 25% of verified savings

**Detailed Example:**

| Element | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Investment | $2M (cloud migration) |
| Annual savings realized | $800K |
| 25% reinvestment | $200K/year |
| After 5 years | $1M returned to fund |
| Net fund position | -$2M investment + $1M return = -$1M, with ongoing $600K/year agency benefit |
| After 10 years | $2M returned (break-even), with $6M cumulative agency benefit |

**Reinvestment Allocation:**
- 50% to Quick Wins (maintain momentum)
- 30% to Strategic Initiatives (sustain major modernization)
- 20% to Innovation Ventures (continue exploration)

**Long-Term Sustainability:**

| Year | Investments | Savings Realized | Reinvestment | Fund Balance | What's Happening |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | $30M | $2M | $0.5M | $70.5M | Heavy investment phase |
| 2 | $30M | $8M | $2M | $42.5M | Projects starting to pay off |
| 3 | $25M | $15M | $3.75M | $21.25M | Savings accelerating |
| 4 | $20M | $20M | $5M | $6.25M | Approaching break-even |
| 5 | $10M | $25M | $6.25M | $2.5M | Self-sustaining threshold |
| 6+ | ~$6M | $30M+ | $7.5M+ | Growing | Reinvestment funds ongoing work |

**Key Insight:** By Year 5-7, annual reinvestment ($6-8M) exceeds what's needed for ongoing Quick Wins and maintenance. The fund becomes permanently self-sustaining while agencies keep 75% of savings ($22.5M+ annually by Year 5).

#### Internal State Team Incentives

**Purpose:** Create aligned incentives for state workers to drive modernization success. Beyond the 25% fund reinvestment, a portion of first-year savings rewards the team that generated them.

> **Why Incentives Matter:** Risk aversion strangles modernization. Nobody wants to own a project that might fail. The 10% bonus pool gives both the executive who stakes their reputation AND the staff who work around the clock a reason to take the risk. This is how you break the "nobody wants to own this" problem.

**Performance Bonus for Modernization Teams:**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Bonus Pool** | 10% of documented first-year General Fund return |
| **Distribution** | Split equally among executive sponsor (CEA) + full-time modernization staff |
| **Payment Timing** | Paid in second year after return is verified |
| **Eligibility** | Minimum 6 months on project |
| **Why Include CEA** | Executives take career risk championing modernization; incentive must reward that risk |
| **Why Include Staff** | Staff work around the clock to deliver; shared success motivates performance |

**Example:**

| Element | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Project investment | $500K (process automation) |
| First-year verified savings | $1M |
| 10% bonus pool | $100K |
| Team size | 10 staff (1 executive sponsor + 9 FTEs) |
| Per-person bonus | $10K each |
| Timing | Paid in Year 2 after savings verified |

**First-Year ROI Definition:**

Verified return to General Fund includes:
- Reduced operational costs (staff reallocation, vendor spend reduction, infrastructure savings)
- Reduced litigation costs (fewer errors, better compliance)
- Avoided costs (prevented failures, reduced fraud)
- Revenue increases (faster processing, improved collections)

**Governance and Safeguards:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Return Certification** | Department of Finance certifies savings calculation |
| **Eligibility Validation** | TMO validates staff participation (minimum 6 months) |
| **Tax Treatment** | Subject to standard payroll taxes |
| **Conflict Prevention** | Executive sponsor bonus capped at 2x average team member |
| **Transparency** | All bonus payments disclosed in annual fund report |

**Why This Matters:**

- **Aligned incentives:** Teams benefit directly from savings they generate
- **Retention:** Rewards keep modernization talent in state service
- **Culture change:** Shifts from "spend the budget" to "generate savings"
- **Credibility:** Demonstrates state values efficiency, not just compliance
- **Sustainability:** Combined with 25% reinvestment, creates virtuous cycle

**Risk Mitigation:**

| Risk | Safeguard |
|------|-----------|
| Inflated savings claims | Third-party validation for savings >$1M |
| Gaming metrics | Multi-year verification; clawback for reversed savings |
| Inequitable distribution | Equal split with capped executive portion |
| Political backlash | Transparent reporting; tied to verified public benefit |

## 7. Conclusion: Sustainable Funding for Modernization

> **Section Summary:** The Breakthrough Fund creates a sustainable investment mechanism that breaks the annual budget cycle and enables long-term transformation.

The proposed Breakthrough Modernization Fund represents a fundamental shift from annual appropriation battles to sustainable, performance-based investment. With $100M in initial capitalization ($50M state, $50M private sector), the fund would provide:

**Stable Multi-Year Investment Capacity:**
- Pre-authorized funding for approved modernization initiatives
- Multi-year commitment enables complex transformation projects
- Political transitions don't disrupt in-flight initiatives

**Portfolio Approach to Risk:**
- Diversified investments across Quick Wins, Transformational Projects, and Moonshots
- Higher-risk initiatives funded alongside proven approaches
- Acceptance that not all investments succeed—learning from both successes and failures

**Private Sector Partnership:**
- 50/50 co-investment model brings external accountability
- Access to private sector expertise and methodologies
- Shared risk and shared learning

**Path to Self-Sustainability:**
- 25% of realized savings reinvested in the fund
- Projected self-sustainability by Years 5-7
- Creates permanent modernization capacity

**Transparent Accountability:**
- Quarterly reporting on portfolio performance
- Public dashboards showing real-time project status
- Clear metrics tied to citizen impact and cost savings

The Breakthrough Fund would enable California to break free from the short-term thinking that perpetuates legacy systems and deferred modernization. By providing stable, performance-based funding with private sector partnership and transparent accountability, the fund creates the financial foundation for sustained transformation.

This funding approach is particularly critical as AI transforms service delivery across sectors. AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, and organizations that can move quickly will capture significant efficiency gains and service improvements. Traditional annual budget cycles cannot keep pace with this evolution. The Breakthrough Fund gives California the agility to adopt AI responsibly as opportunities emerge—ensuring the state leads rather than lags in applying these transformative technologies to improve government efficiency and citizen service.
