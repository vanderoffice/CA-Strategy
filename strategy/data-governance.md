## 3. Independent Office of State Data Governance

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes the Independent Office of State Data Governance with cross-branch authority, including board composition, responsibilities, and standardized data sharing agreement templates.

### 3.1 Constitutional Model and Precedent

The Independent Office of State Data Governance follows California's Little Hoover Commission model: cross-branch appointments, staggered terms, statutory authority, and independence from any single agency.

**Why Independence Matters:**
- E3 leaders need enforceable data sharing authority, not just coordination roles
- Single-agency governance (e.g., within GovOps) lacks legitimacy across other cabinet agencies
- Legislative/judicial branches require data too; executive-only governance excludes them
- Political transitions shouldn't reset data governance; institutional continuity essential

*Note: Establishing the Independent Office of State Data Governance requires enabling legislation. The cross-branch appointment structure and binding authority outlined below cannot be achieved through executive order alone. This recommendation assumes legislative partnership and should be developed in coordination with the Legislature.*

**Legislative Strategy and Timeline:**

| Phase | Timeline | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Draft Development** | Months 1-3 | Develop model legislation with Governor's office and legislative counsel; stakeholder consultation |
| **Legislative Introduction** | Months 4-6 | Bill introduction; committee hearings; amendments |
| **Passage Target** | Months 7-10 | Floor votes; conference committee if needed; Governor signature |
| **Board Formation** | Months 11-14 | Appointment process; initial board meetings; hire Executive Director |
| **Operational Launch** | Months 15-18 | Office staffing; initial standards development; begin data sharing framework |

**Interim Governance (If Legislation Delayed):**

If enabling legislation is not enacted by Month 12, the following interim structure will operate under executive authority:

1. **California Interagency Data Council (CIDC):** Executive-branch-only body convened by GovOps Secretary with representation from all cabinet agencies. Limited to executive branch coordination; cannot bind legislative/judicial branches.

2. **Interim Powers:** CIDC can develop draft standards, pilot data sharing agreements between executive agencies, and build technical infrastructure. All work designed to transition seamlessly to Independent Office once established.

3. **Limitations Acknowledged:** Interim structure lacks cross-branch authority and binding enforcement. Data sharing with courts, Legislature, and external entities will require case-by-case negotiation until Independent Office established.

4. **Advocacy Continuation:** TMO and E3 leaders continue legislative advocacy; provide progress reports demonstrating value of data sharing to build support for full authorization.

**Transition from CIDC to Independent Office:**

When enabling legislation is enacted, the transition process ensures continuity of data governance work:

| Transition Element | Timeline | Process |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| **Board Appointments** | 60 days post-enactment | Appointing authorities nominate board members; Governor convenes first meeting |
| **CIDC Asset Transfer** | 90 days | Draft standards, pilot agreements, technical infrastructure transfer to Independent Office; CIDC dissolved |
| **Staff Transition** | 90-120 days | CIDC technical staff offered positions with Independent Office; hiring for additional capacity |
| **Ongoing Work Continuity** | Immediate | All active data sharing pilots continue without interruption; agreements signed under CIDC authority remain valid |
| **Cross-Branch Expansion** | 120 days | Independent Office begins engaging judicial and legislative branches for cross-branch data governance |

**Key Principles:**
- No disruption to active data sharing projects
- CIDC-developed standards become foundation for Independent Office standards (refined with cross-branch input)
- Technical infrastructure investments (APIs, data catalogs) remain operational
- Lessons learned from CIDC pilots inform Independent Office policies

This transition approach ensures that interim progress accelerates rather than delays full implementation.

### 3.2 Board Composition (9 Members Minimum)

**Required Seats:**
1. Governor appointment #1
2. Governor appointment #2
3. Senate Rules Committee appointment
4. Assembly Speaker appointment
5. Judicial Council appointment
6. UC Regents representative
7. CSU Board representative
8. **Public seat (REQUIRED)** - citizen perspective, accountability
9. **Breakthrough partner / digital industry representative (REQUIRED)** - private sector expertise, co-learning

**Senior Technical Advisor Requirement:**
Each board seat must have an assigned Senior Technical Advisor who provides technical expertise, reviews standards, and advises their appointing member. These advisors should be experienced technology professionals at a senior level (e.g., senior architects, engineering managers, data science leads, or equivalent)—not necessarily holding a formal "Chief" or "Officer" title. This ensures board decisions are technically sound and implementable while allowing flexibility in how appointing authorities staff this advisory function.

**Term Structure:**
- Staggered 3-year terms
- Survives administration transitions
- Cross-branch legitimacy

### 3.3 Authority and Responsibilities

#### Binding Powers
- Set statewide data standards (schemas, formats, quality rules)
- Approve/mandate data sharing frameworks
- Establish statewide AI governance standards (approved use cases, human oversight, bias testing, transparency)
- Convene all branches for policy development
- Enforce compliance through budget/procurement mechanisms

#### Key Functions
- Develop statewide data architecture enabling AI adoption
- Resolve inter-agency data disputes
- Protect privacy while enabling sharing and responsible AI use
- Maintain registry of approved AI applications and oversight requirements
- Annual reporting to Legislature on data governance and AI deployment

#### Authority Delegation and Coordination

The data governance structure operates at three levels with clearly defined decision authority:

| Decision Level | Authority | Scope | Examples |
|----------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Department-Level** | Chief Deputy Director + Data Governance Team | Public data exchange within agency; non-sensitive operational data sharing | DMV shares aggregate vehicle data with Air Resources Board (Template 1) |
| **Agency-Level** | Undersecretary for E&E | Confidential data with limited PII within agency; cross-department coordination | Health and Human Services shares licensing data between departments (Template 2) |
| **Cross-Agency / Sensitive** | Independent Office Board | Sensitive PII, cross-agency sensitive data, cross-branch sharing | Corrections shares inmate data with Social Services (Template 3); Executive shares data with Judicial Council (Template 4) |

#### Escalation and Dispute Resolution

When data governance councils disagree or sharing crosses agency boundaries with sensitive data, the Independent Office provides binding arbitration:

1. **Agency-internal disputes** → Undersecretary resolves (with data governance team support)
2. **Cross-agency operational disputes** → TMO facilitates resolution between Undersecretaries
3. **Cross-agency sensitive data disputes** → Independent Office Board provides binding decision
4. **Cross-branch disputes** → Independent Office Board (includes judicial, legislative representation)

This structure ensures rapid decision-making for routine data sharing while maintaining appropriate oversight for sensitive categories and cross-agency coordination.

### 3.4 Data Sharing Agreement Templates

Data sharing negotiations currently take 12-18 months because every agreement is custom. Standardized templates reduce this to 4-8 weeks. For a complete sample, see [Template A.2](../appendices/templates.md#a2-data-sharing-agreement-template-type-3-moderate-sensitivity).

| Template | Sensitivity | Approval Time | Approver |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **1. Public Data** | Non-sensitive | 2-4 weeks | CDD |
| **2. Limited PII** | Moderate | 4-6 weeks | CDD + governance team |
| **3. Sensitive** | High (criminal justice, health) | 6-8 weeks | Undersecretary + Independent Office |
| **4. Cross-Branch** | Variable | 8-12 weeks | Independent Office Board |

#### Template Details

**Template 1 (Public):** Non-sensitive data like business registries, aggregate statistics. Simple MOU with attribution requirements.

**Template 2 (Limited PII):** Permit applications, licensing records, low-risk health data. Includes access controls, audit logging, breach notification.

**Template 3 (Sensitive):** Criminal justice, child welfare, mental health, financial. Enhanced protections including encryption, independent privacy review, strict purpose limitation.

**Template 4 (Cross-Branch):** Sharing with Legislature, courts, federal/local governments, academics. Requires statutory authority citation, sunset clauses, public transparency.

#### Benefits of Templates
- **Speed:** 90% reduction in negotiation time
- **Legal clarity:** Pre-vetted language reduces risk
- **Consistency:** Similar use cases treated similarly
- **Transparency:** Public can see standard terms
- **Scalability:** New agreements use proven patterns
