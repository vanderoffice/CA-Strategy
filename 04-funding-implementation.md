## 6. The California Breakthrough Modernization Fund

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes a $100M fund governed by portfolio management principles with a sustainability mechanism that reinvests 25% of realized savings. The fund's portfolio approach is particularly important as AI capabilities rapidly evolve—dedicated funding enables California to adopt AI opportunities as they mature rather than waiting for annual budget cycles.

This proposal recommends establishing a Breakthrough Modernization Fund that would apply proven private sector and venture capital investment patterns—adapted for public sector accountability requirements. Like a VC portfolio, the fund would accept that not all investments succeed; diversification across risk categories maximizes overall return while limiting exposure to any single failure. Unlike traditional government budgets that treat each project as pass/fail, this portfolio approach would enable the higher-risk, higher-reward initiatives essential for transformational change while maintaining fiscal responsibility through stage-gate oversight and transparent performance measurement.

### 6.1 Fund Purpose and Structure

**Fund Overview:**

The proposed California Breakthrough Modernization Fund (Breakthrough Fund) would capitalize modernization initiatives, specifically the Fellowship program and the E3 positions. Unlike traditional government budgets that require annual appropriation battles, the Breakthrough Fund would operate with multi-year investment authority using portfolio management principles.

**Why a Dedicated Fund:**

**Multi-Year Horizon:**
- Modernization projects span 2-5 years; annual budget uncertainty disrupts delivery
- Fund provides stable, predictable investment capacity
- Political transitions don't interrupt in-flight initiatives
- Long-term thinking enabled by long-term funding

**Portfolio Approach:**
- Not all investments succeed; portfolio management expects and accounts for failure
- Higher-risk/higher-reward initiatives funded alongside proven approaches
- Cross-subsidy: successful projects generate savings that fund future projects
- Diversified investment reduces catastrophic failure risk

**Speed and Flexibility:**
- Pre-authorized funding for approved project types
- Reduced approval cycles (weeks instead of months)
- Rapid response to opportunities (emerging AI capabilities, new technologies, partnership offers)
- Pilot funding available without annual budget process
- Ability to move quickly as AI tools mature—critical given the pace of AI advancement

**Accountability:**
- Clear success metrics and public reporting
- Performance-based continuation (projects that fail don't get refunded)
- Transparency to Legislature, press, and public
- Private sector co-investment creates external accountability

### 6.1.1 Private Sector Partnership Framework

> **Guiding Principle:** Private sector partnership enhances accountability and brings expertise, but must be structured to avoid conflicts of interest, preserve public control, and maintain transparency. Partners contribute capital and knowledge; they do not gain preferential treatment in procurement.

**Fund Capitalization:**
- State appropriation: $50M one-time
- Private sector contribution: $50M (per framework below)
- **Total initial fund: $100M**

**Partnership Categories:**

| Category | Contribution Type | Role in Governance | Restrictions |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Philanthropic Partners** | Grant capital (no ROI expectation) | Advisory only; no voting | Standard disclosure |
| **Civic Technology Partners** | In-kind expertise, fellowships, research | Advisory; may serve on Investment Committee | Cannot bid on funded projects |
| **Corporate Partners** | Capital contribution, expertise sharing | Rotating observer on Investment Committee | Strict procurement firewall (see below) |
| **Federal/Foundation Grants** | Grant capital | Per grant terms | Grant compliance |

**Contribution Tiers:**

| Tier | Contribution | Recognition | Engagement Level |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Founding Partner** | $5M+ | Named partnership, annual report recognition | Quarterly strategy briefings; eligible for Committee observer role |
| **Innovation Partner** | $1M-$4.9M | Annual report recognition | Semi-annual briefings; RFI² challenge co-sponsorship |
| **Supporting Partner** | $250K-$999K | Website recognition | Annual briefings; event participation |
| **In-Kind Partner** | Equivalent value | Website recognition | Per contribution agreement |

**Procurement Firewall (Critical for Public Trust):**

To ensure public trust and avoid conflicts of interest:

1. **No Bid Privilege:** Partners receive *no preferential treatment* in any procurement process. Contributing capital does not influence vendor selection.

2. **Recusal Requirements:**
   - Partners must recuse from any Investment Committee discussion involving projects where they might bid
   - Partners cannot serve on evaluation committees for projects they may pursue
   - 12-month cooling-off period: Partners who exit partnership cannot bid on funded projects for 12 months

3. **Transparency:**
   - All partnership agreements publicly posted
   - All contributions disclosed in quarterly reports
   - Investment Committee meeting minutes (with appropriate redactions) published
   - Any perceived conflict flagged and documented with resolution

4. **Structural Separation:**
   - Corporate partners' contributions go to general fund pool, not earmarked projects
   - Partner representatives on Investment Committee serve as non-voting observers
   - Voting authority remains with government officials only

**Partner Value Proposition:**

Why would private sector entities contribute without procurement advantage?

| Partner Type | Value Received |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Philanthropic Foundations** | Mission alignment (civic tech, digital equity); measurable impact on California residents |
| **Technology Companies** | Demonstrated commitment to public sector; talent pipeline exposure; industry leadership reputation |
| **Consulting Firms** | Relationship building with state leadership (within ethical bounds); thought leadership platform |
| **Academic Institutions** | Research access; student placement; policy influence |
| **Civic Tech Organizations** | Scale impact; influence on government modernization practices |

**Target Partner Mix:**

| Partner Category | Target Contribution | Potential Sources |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Philanthropic Foundations | $15M | Foundations focused on civic technology, digital equity, government innovation |
| Civic Tech Organizations | $10M (including in-kind) | National civic technology organizations, digital service nonprofits |
| Corporate Partners | $15M | Technology companies, consulting firms (with procurement firewall) |
| Federal Grants | $10M | NSF, GSA Technology Modernization Fund, other federal programs |

**Partnership Governance:**

- **Partnership Director** (within TMO): Manages relationships, ensures compliance, reports to Investment Committee
- **Partnership Agreement Template:** Standardized agreement covering contribution terms, recognition, restrictions, exit provisions
- **Annual Partnership Review:** Assess partner engagement, contribution status, compliance, renewal

**Risk Mitigation:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Partner expects procurement favor | Explicit agreement terms; recusal requirements; public transparency |
| Perception of pay-to-play | Philanthropic partners prioritized; firewall enforcement; public disclosure |
| Partner exit mid-commitment | Multi-year pledges with annual tranches; diversified partner base |
| Insufficient partner interest | Phased approach; state can proceed at reduced scale if needed |

**Fallback Position:**

If private sector partnership is delayed or falls short of $50M target:
- State proceeds with $50M appropriation
- Fund operates at smaller scale (50% of planned investments Year 1-2)
- Partnership continues to be cultivated; contributions added as secured
- Partnership positioned as enhancement, not requirement

### 6.2 Investment Categories

**Category 1: Quick Wins (40% of portfolio)**
- **Investment Range:** $100K-$500K per initiative
- **Timeline:** 3-6 months to completion
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate value, build momentum, generate early savings

**Stage-Gate Reviews:**
- All investments subject to stage-gate reviews (planning, development, deployment, operations)
- Go/no-go decisions at each gate based on progress and risk assessment
- Underperforming projects redirected or terminated early
- Lessons learned captured regardless of outcome

### 6.4 Sustainability Mechanism

**Reinvestment Model:**

The Breakthrough Fund includes a sustainability mechanism that diverts a portion of realized savings back to the fund, creating self-sustaining modernization capacity.

**Savings Calculation:**
- Projects track baseline costs (before modernization)
- Post-implementation costs measured for 12-24 months
- Verified savings calculated: (Baseline - Post-Implementation) × Duration
- Third-party validation for savings above $1M

**Reinvestment Rate:** 25% of verified savings

**Example:**
| Element | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Investment | $2M (cloud migration) |
| Annual savings realized | $800K |
| 25% reinvestment | $200K/year |
| After 5 years | $1M returned to fund |
| Net fund position | -$1M investment + $1M return = break-even, with ongoing $600K/year agency benefit |

**Reinvestment Allocation:**
- 50% to Quick Wins (maintain momentum)
- 30% to Strategic Initiatives (sustain major modernization)
- 20% to Innovation Ventures (continue exploration)

**Long-Term Sustainability:**

| Year | Investments | Savings Realized | Reinvestment | Fund Balance |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | $30M | $2M | $0.5M | $70.5M |
| 2 | $30M | $8M | $2M | $42.5M |
| 3 | $25M | $15M | $3.75M | $21.25M |
| 4 | $20M | $20M | $5M | $6.25M |
| 5 | $10M | $25M | $6.25M | $2.5M (+ ongoing reinvestment) |

*Note: Fund projected to become self-sustaining by Year 5-7 through reinvestment of realized savings*

*For detailed sustainability calculations and projections, see [Appendix B.3: Breakthrough Fund Sustainability Model](appendices/07-operational-guides.md#b3-breakthrough-fund-sustainability-model).*

## 7. Conclusion: Sustainable Funding for Modernization

> **Section Summary:** The Breakthrough Fund creates a sustainable investment mechanism that breaks the annual budget cycle and enables long-term transformation.

The proposed Breakthrough Modernization Fund represents a fundamental shift from annual appropriation battles to sustainable, performance-based investment. With $100M in initial capitalization ($50M state, $50M private sector), the fund would provide:

**Stable Multi-Year Investment Capacity:**
- Pre-authorized funding for approved modernization initiatives
- Multi-year commitment enables complex transformation projects
- Political transitions don't disrupt in-flight initiatives

**Portfolio Approach to Risk:**
- Diversified investments across Quick Wins, Transformational Projects, and Moonshots
- Higher-risk initiatives funded alongside proven approaches
- Acceptance that not all investments succeed—learning from both successes and failures

**Private Sector Partnership:**
- 50/50 co-investment model brings external accountability
- Access to private sector expertise and methodologies
- Shared risk and shared learning

**Path to Self-Sustainability:**
- 25% of realized savings reinvested in the fund
- Projected self-sustainability by Years 5-7
- Creates permanent modernization capacity

**Transparent Accountability:**
- Quarterly reporting on portfolio performance
- Public dashboards showing real-time project status
- Clear metrics tied to citizen impact and cost savings

The Breakthrough Fund would enable California to break free from the short-term thinking that perpetuates legacy systems and deferred modernization. By providing stable, performance-based funding with private sector partnership and transparent accountability, the fund creates the financial foundation for sustained transformation.

This funding approach is particularly critical as AI transforms service delivery across sectors. AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, and organizations that can move quickly will capture significant efficiency gains and service improvements. Traditional annual budget cycles cannot keep pace with this evolution. The Breakthrough Fund gives California the agility to adopt AI responsibly as opportunities emerge—ensuring the state leads rather than lags in applying these transformative technologies to improve government efficiency and citizen service.
