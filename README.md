## Overview

California's state government operates across **170 departments** serving nearly 40 million residents. Modernizing this vast infrastructure requires:

- **Strategic Vision**: Clear direction for technology investments
- **Objective Assessment**: Data-driven prioritization of modernization efforts
- **Governance Frameworks**: Structures that enable execution at scale

This repository provides the foundational documents that guide these efforts, developed in collaboration with the Office of Data and Innovation and the Governor's Office of Operations.
