# California Enterprise Modernization Plan

**A comprehensive strategy to transform how California state government delivers services to 40 million residents.**

---

## The Challenge

California state government operates 170 departments with 230,000+ employees—but lacks the natural forcing mechanism that drives private sector efficiency. The result:

- **70-80%** of IT budgets consumed by maintaining legacy systems
- **12-18 months** for routine data sharing agreements
- **12-18 months** average procurement cycles
- **$3B+** lost to fraud, failed IT projects, and unqualified leadership (2024-2025)

## The Solution

The **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model** creates institutional accountability for modernization through dedicated leadership positions, sustainable funding, and cross-branch data governance—backed by **Technical Executive Standards** ensuring qualified leadership for technology positions.
