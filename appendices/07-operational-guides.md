**Phase 1: Problem Statement (Weeks 1-3)**

Cross-functional team (program staff, IT, E3 leaders, ODI) defines:

**Problem Statement Components:**
- **Current State:** What's broken? (quantified with specific metrics)
- **Target Metric:** What does success look like? (specific, measurable outcomes)
- **Constraints:** Budget, timeline, must-integrate-with systems, regulatory requirements
- **Evaluation Criteria:** How prototypes will be judged (weighted criteria)

**Team Composition:**
- Program SME (understands the business problem)
- IT representative (understands technical landscape)
- E3 CDD or designee (owns decision authority)
- ODI advisor (ensures human-centered design principles)
- TMO Challenge Manager (manages logistics)

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Problem is outcome-focused, not solution-prescriptive
- [ ] Metrics are specific and measurable
- [ ] Constraints are realistic and documented
- [ ] Evaluation criteria are objective and weighted
- [ ] Timeline allows for vendor preparation

**Example Problem Statement:**

> **Challenge:** Foster care application processing takes 45 days average. Staff spend 40% of time re-keying data from PDF forms into the case management system. 60% of applications require manual review due to missing or inconsistent data.
>
> **Target:** Reduce processing time to <5 days. Achieve 85% auto-adjudication rate for complete applications.
>
> **Constraint:** Must integrate with Legacy System X via existing API. Must comply with HIPAA and state privacy requirements. Budget envelope: $50K per prototype, $5M for production implementation.
>
> **We seek:** A partner to prototype a solution demonstrating how caseworkers can achieve these targets. We are not prescribing technology stack, provided it adheres to State Technology Standards (Appendix H).

### B.3 Breakthrough Fund Sustainability Model

This appendix provides a detailed worked example of how the Breakthrough Fund sustainability model operates. For the strategic overview, see [Section 6.4: Sustainability Mechanism](./04-funding-implementation.md#64-sustainability-mechanism).

---

**Worked Example: Business Licensing Automation**

**Step 1: Project Delivers Measurable Savings**

A Breakthrough Fund investment of $3M modernizes business licensing across three agencies:
- Processing time reduced from 45 days to 3 days
- Staffing reduced from 20 FTE to 8 FTE through automation
- Staff reassigned to higher-value work (compliance, outreach)

**Savings Calculation:**
- 12 FTE positions no longer needed for processing
- Average loaded cost per FTE: $100,000/year
- **Annual cost reduction: $1.2M**

---

**Step 2: Department Budget Adjusted**

Following validation of sustained savings (typically 1 fiscal year of demonstrated performance):
- Department baseline budget reduced by $1.2M
- Reduction implemented in subsequent fiscal year
- Staff reassignment or attrition managed through normal HR processes

---

**Step 3: Fixed 25% Diverted to Breakthrough Fund**

Per policy, 25% of realized savings flow back to the Breakthrough Fund:
- 25% of $1.2M = **$300K diverted to Breakthrough Fund annually**
- 75% of $1.2M = **$900K returns to General Fund**

This continues for the life of the project (typically 5-7 years before system refresh required).

---

**Step 4: Reinvestment Creates Next Generation Projects**

The $300K annual contribution funds new modernization:
- Year 1: $300K available
- Year 2: $600K cumulative (if no new projects funded)
- Years 3-5: As more projects mature, contributions compound

**Portfolio Effect:**

| Year | Active Projects | Annual Savings Generated | 25% to Fund | Cumulative Fund Growth |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | 5 pilots | $2M | $500K | $500K |
| 2 | 10 projects | $6M | $1.5M | $2M |
| 3 | 18 projects | $12M | $3M | $5M |
| 4 | 25 projects | $20M | $5M | $10M |
| 5 | 30 projects | $30M | $7.5M | $17.5M |

---

**Self-Sustainability Threshold**

The fund becomes self-sustaining when annual reinvestment inflows equal or exceed annual investment needs:

- **Target annual investment capacity:** $15-20M (10-15 new projects per year)
- **Required annual savings generation:** $60-80M (to produce $15-20M at 25%)
- **Estimated time to self-sustainability:** 5-7 years from initial $100M capitalization

At self-sustainability:
- Private sector partners can exit or continue
- General Fund contribution no longer required
- Fund operates as permanent modernization engine

---

**Risk Factors and Mitigation**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Projects don't deliver savings | Stage-gate process kills underperformers early |
| Savings not captured in budget | TMO tracks savings; automatic budget adjustment policy |
| Departments resist budget reduction | Savings reinvested in department priorities; not purely extractive |
| Political pressure to redirect funds | Statutory protection for 25% diversion; transparent reporting |
| Diminishing returns (low-hanging fruit exhausted) | See Long-Term Sustainability Note below |

**Long-Term Sustainability Note:**

This model assumes continued discovery of modernization opportunities with at least 60% ROI. As early Quick Wins are completed, remaining opportunities may be more complex and expensive with lower returns. If annual reinvestment drops below $10M by Year 6:

1. **Trigger Review:** TMO conducts strategic assessment of remaining modernization backlog
2. **Options:** (a) Expand scope to include operational efficiency beyond IT, (b) Increase reinvestment percentage from 25% to 35%, (c) Request General Fund supplemental appropriation
3. **Contingency:** State commits to baseline funding (~$10M/year) if self-sustainability not achieved by Year 7

The goal is self-sustainability, but modernization is too important to abandon if the financial model requires adjustment.

---

### B.4 Labor Relations Strategy

This appendix provides guidance for engaging labor unions in enterprise modernization initiatives. Successful modernization requires partnership with labor organizations representing state employees.

---

**Guiding Principles**

1. **No Layoffs from Modernization:** Efficiency gains redirect staff to higher-value work, not unemployment
2. **Upskilling Over Displacement:** Training programs prepare workers for evolving roles
3. **Early Engagement:** Labor consulted before, not after, modernization decisions
4. **Transparency:** Clear communication about timelines, impacts, and opportunities
5. **Shared Benefits:** Productivity gains benefit both service delivery and workforce

---

**Classification and Compensation Considerations**

**New Position Development:**
- Data governance teams require new or modified classifications
- Coordinate with CalHR and relevant bargaining units on position specifications
- Ensure competitive compensation to attract technical talent (see Section 5.4 on science/engineering classifications)

**Career Pathways:**
- Define clear advancement paths from technician to specialist to senior roles
- Recognize certifications and skill development in classification requirements
- Enable mobility between departments for career growth

**Meet and Confer Requirements:**
- Engage unions early on new position classifications
- Provide advance notice of organizational changes
- Document agreements and implementation timelines

---

**Workforce Transition Framework**

**When Automation Reduces Workload:**

| Phase | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Assessment | Identify affected positions | 6+ months before go-live |
| Notification | Inform employees and unions | 4+ months before go-live |
| Options | Present reassignment, retraining, or attrition choices | 3+ months before go-live |
| Transition | Execute reassignments, begin training | At go-live |
| Support | Continued training and adjustment | 6-12 months post go-live |

**Attrition Management:**
- Natural attrition (retirements, voluntary departures) absorbs most position reductions
- Hiring freezes in affected classifications accelerate attrition-based reduction
- No involuntary separations from modernization initiatives

**Enforcement of No-Layoff Commitment:**

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Monitoring** | TMO tracks all separations monthly; flags any coded as "modernization-related" |
| **Reporting** | Quarterly reports to Governor's Office and labor unions on workforce transitions |
| **Escalation** | Departments proposing layoffs must demonstrate: (1) exhausted reassignment options, (2) offered retraining, (3) attrition timeline infeasible. TMO Director and CalHR Deputy Director must concur before any exception. |
| **Consequences** | Departments violating commitment lose access to Breakthrough Fund, face E3 leader performance review |
| **Employee Remedy** | Affected employees may appeal to CalHR; reinstatement + back pay if separation found improper |

**Reassignment Priorities:**
1. Within same department to higher-value work
2. To growing functions (data governance, customer service, compliance)
3. To other departments with needs matching employee skills
4. To new positions created by modernization

---

**Union Engagement Protocol**

**Statewide Level:**
- TMO briefs statewide union leadership quarterly on modernization initiatives
- Formal meet and confer on policies affecting represented employees
- Union representatives invited to Breakthrough Fund review committees

**Department Level:**
- E3 leaders include labor relations in modernization planning
- Advance consultation on workflow changes affecting bargaining unit work
- Regular communication through established labor-management committees

**Project Level:**
- Include union consultation in project stage-gate criteria
- Document workforce impact assessments
- Track and report on job transitions

---

**Training Coordination**

**Digital Accelerators Program Integration:**
- Coordinate training schedules with workload and staffing requirements
- Ensure protected learning time (20% of work hours) is operationally feasible
- Partner with unions on training curriculum relevant to represented employees

**Certification Recognition:**
- Work with CalHR to recognize industry certifications in classification specifications
- Enable pay differentials for certified skills where appropriate
- Document certification requirements in duty statements

---

**Success Metrics**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Employees displaced (involuntary separation) | 0 |
| Employees successfully reassigned | 100% of affected |
| Training completion rate | 95%+ |
| Union grievances related to modernization | <5 per year statewide |
| Employee satisfaction with transition | >70% positive |

---

**Escalation Path**

Unresolved labor issues escalate through:
1. Department labor relations → Agency labor relations
2. Agency labor relations → CalHR Labor Relations Division
3. CalHR → State Mediation and Conciliation Service (if needed)
4. Critical issues → TMO and Governor's Office awareness

## B.5: Citizen Journey Teams Operating Guide

> **Guide Purpose:** Provides comprehensive framework for organizing cross-agency teams around citizen life events, enabling seamless integrated services that transcend traditional agency boundaries.

---

### B.5.1 The Journey-Centric Model

**Organizing Around Life Events:**

Traditional government organizes around agencies. Citizens experience life events that require multiple agencies:
- Having a baby (Health, Vital Records, Social Services, Tax)
- Starting a business (Secretary of State, Tax, Licensing, Permitting)
- Disaster recovery (Emergency Services, Housing, Insurance, Small Business)
- Losing a job (EDD, Covered California, CalFresh, Workforce Development)
- Caring for aging parents (Aging Services, Medi-Cal, In-Home Support, Regional Centers)

Citizen Journey Teams bring together E3 leaders, SMEs, and Fellows from relevant agencies to redesign experiences around these journeys, creating seamless integrated services.

**Why Journey Teams Work:**

| Traditional Approach | Journey Team Approach |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Citizen navigates multiple agencies | Single coordinated experience |
| Each agency owns a transaction | Team owns the outcome |
| Data stays in silos | Shared data (with consent) |
| Success = processing volume | Success = citizen satisfaction |
| Accountability unclear | Executive Sponsor accountable |

---

### B.5.2 Team Structure and Governance

**Core Team Composition:**

| Role | Source | Responsibility | Time Commitment |
|------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Executive Sponsor** | Undersecretary from lead agency | Champion, resource allocation, barrier removal, final decisions | 4-8 hrs/month |
| **Journey Lead** | Senior Fellow or CDD | Day-to-day leadership, coordination, delivery, team management | Full-time (6-12 months) |
| **Agency Representatives** | CDDs or delegates from each participating agency | Subject matter expertise, agency commitment, implementation authority | 50% (during design/build) |
| **Design Lead** | ODI CalInnovate | User research, service design, prototyping, testing | 50-100% (varies by phase) |
| **Technical Lead** | TMO or agency IT | Architecture, API integration, data sharing, security | 50-100% (varies by phase) |
| **Data Governance** | Data governance team members | Data standards, privacy, sharing agreements, compliance | 25% (ongoing) |
| **Communications Lead** | Agency PIO or TMO | Stakeholder communications, change management, rollout messaging | 25% (varies by phase) |

**Extended Team (Engaged as Needed):**

- Legal counsel (data sharing, liability, regulatory compliance)
- Privacy officer (PIA review, consent management)
- Procurement specialist (vendor management, contracts)
- Labor relations (workforce impact, union coordination)
- Accessibility specialist (WCAG compliance, inclusive design)

**Team Chartering Process:**

1. **Sponsor Selection (Week 1):** Governor's Office or E3 Council designates Executive Sponsor based on lead agency and journey scope
2. **Charter Development (Weeks 2-3):** Sponsor works with TMO to draft charter including:
   - Problem statement and journey scope
   - Participating agencies and commitment levels
   - Success metrics and targets
   - Timeline and major milestones
   - Resource requirements and funding source
   - Decision authority and escalation path
   - Risks and dependencies
3. **Agency Commitment (Week 4):** Each participating agency's E3 leader signs charter, committing staff resources
4. **Kickoff (Week 5):** Full team convenes; roles assigned; operating norms established

### B.5.4 Cross-Agency Accountability

**Challenge:** Journey teams span agencies with different priorities, budgets, and leadership. How do we ensure sustained commitment?

**Accountability Mechanisms:**

1. **Charter Commitments:** Written agency commitments with E3 leader signatures
2. **Sponsor Authority:** Executive Sponsor has escalation path to Governor's Office
3. **E3 Performance:** E3 leaders include journey team performance in their OKRs
4. **TMO Visibility:** TMO tracks all journey teams; reports status to E3 Council
5. **Public Dashboard:** Journey metrics visible on public modernization dashboard

**Escalation Path:**

| Issue Level | Resolution Forum | Timeline |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Team operational issues | Journey Lead | 48 hours |
| Resource/commitment gaps | Executive Sponsor | 1 week |
| Inter-agency conflicts | E3 Council | 2 weeks |
| Strategic disagreements | GovOps Secretary | 2 weeks |
| Political/policy barriers | Governor's Office | As needed |

**When Things Go Wrong:**

- **Missed commitments:** Sponsor discusses with agency E3 leader; documents impact; escalates if unresolved
- **Scope creep:** Journey Lead refers to charter; Sponsor approves or rejects expansions
- **Technical blockers:** Technical Lead escalates to CDT; TMO facilitates resolution
- **Staff resistance:** Agency Reps work with labor relations; apply ADKAR change management
- **Budget shortfalls:** Sponsor requests Breakthrough Fund support or agency reallocation
