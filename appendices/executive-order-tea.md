# STATE OF CALIFORNIA

## EXECUTIVE ORDER N-XX-26

---

WHEREAS California state government relies on information technology systems to deliver critical services to over 40 million residents, including unemployment insurance, healthcare enrollment, tax collection, law enforcement, and vital records; and

WHEREAS the California State Auditor has designated the Department of Technology's oversight of information technology projects as a high-risk issue continuously since May 2007, a period of eighteen years, finding persistent failures in project management, cost control, and outcome delivery (State Auditor Report 2025-601); and

WHEREAS the California State Auditor has designated information security as a high-risk issue since September 2013, noting ongoing vulnerabilities that place personal data of millions of Californians at risk (State Auditor Report 2025-601); and

WHEREAS the Employment Development Department has experienced fraudulent payments exceeding $500 million in 2024 alone, with improper payments totaling approximately $1.5 billion between 2023 and 2024, representing a failure of technology oversight and security controls (State Auditor Report 2025-601); and

WHEREAS the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal) project, initiated in 2005, has cost taxpayers over $1.06 billion while remaining incomplete after twenty years, representing a systemic failure of technology project leadership across multiple administrations (State Auditor Report 2024-039); and

WHEREAS current Career Executive Assignment minimum qualifications, as established in Government Code Section 19889 and California Code of Regulations Title 2, Section 548, require only general management knowledge and do not mandate domain-specific technical competence for information technology leadership positions; and

WHEREAS the existing technical qualification exception under Government Code Section 19889, which permits specialized requirements for positions requiring licensure as a physician, attorney, engineer, or scientist, does not extend to Chief Information Officers, Chief Information Security Officers, Chief Data Officers, Chief Technology Officers, or other executive information technology positions; and

WHEREAS the absence of technical competence requirements for executive information technology positions creates conditions where non-technical executives may be appointed to oversee billions of dollars in technology spending and critical infrastructure without demonstrated ability to evaluate technical decisions, assess risks, or hold subordinates accountable for technical outcomes; and

WHEREAS effective governance of information technology requires appointing authorities to have confidence that candidates possess verified technical competence, and technical executives to have assurance that their leadership will be evaluated by those capable of understanding technical realities; and

WHEREAS protecting taxpayer investments in technology modernization and safeguarding the personal information of all Californians requires establishing clear technical competence standards for executive information technology positions;

NOW, THEREFORE, I, [GOVERNOR NAME], Governor of the State of California, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the State of California, including but not limited to Government Code sections 11152, 12800, and 19815.4, do hereby issue this Order to become effective immediately:

## Drafter's Notes

### Legal Authority Citations

This Order relies on the following authorities:

| Citation | Authority |
|----------|-----------|
| California Constitution, Article V, §1 | Supreme executive power vested in Governor |
| Government Code §11152 | Governor may assign functions among agencies |
| Government Code §12800 et seq. | Organization of executive branch |
| Government Code §19815.4 | CalHR authority over personnel standards |
| Government Code §19889 | CEA framework (model for technical exceptions) |

### Implementation Considerations

1. **90-day deadline (Section 2b)**: CalHR will need dedicated resources to develop qualification standards. Recommend pre-briefing CalHR Director before EO signature.

2. **Panel roster (Section 4a)**: GovOps should begin identifying potential external experts immediately. Consider partnerships with technology industry associations, universities, and federal technical agencies.

3. **$200K threshold (Section 5b)**: This captures State CIO, most agency CIOs, and senior technical positions. May need adjustment based on current salary data.

4. **Pilot scope (Section 8)**: CDT is appropriate given its 18-year high-risk status. Success at CDT provides proof of concept for expansion.

5. **Audit request (Section 7c)**: State Auditor cannot be compelled by Executive Order. Language is a "request" to include in existing high-risk monitoring.

### Stakeholder Review Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] CalHR Director review
- [ ] CDT Director review
- [ ] GovOps Secretary review
- [ ] Governor's Legal Affairs review
- [ ] State Personnel Board consultation (advisory)
