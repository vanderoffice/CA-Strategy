> **Appendix Summary:** This appendix provides strategic frameworks for five operational programs. For detailed implementation procedures, see the [toolkit folder](../toolkit/).

---

## B.1 Rapid RFI² Framework

**Purpose:** Challenge-based procurement that validates solutions through paid prototypes before major investment.

**Strategic Overview:**

Rapid RFI² replaces traditional procurement's prescriptive specifications with outcome-focused problem statements. Instead of telling vendors *how* to solve problems, the state defines *what* success looks like and lets vendors compete to demonstrate working solutions.

**Core Process (11 weeks total):**

| Phase | Duration | Key Activity |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **1. Problem Statement** | Weeks 1-3 | Cross-functional team defines measurable outcomes, constraints, and evaluation criteria |
| **2. Concept Papers** | Weeks 4-5 | Pre-qualified vendors submit 5-page concepts; top 2-3 selected for prototyping |
| **3. Paid Prototypes** | Weeks 6-10 | Selected vendors receive $50K each to build working prototypes in state sandbox |
| **4. Evaluation & Award** | Week 11 | Live demonstrations; winner awarded Tier 2 contract ($2-15M) for production |

**Success Criteria:**

- Problem statements are outcome-focused, not solution-prescriptive
- Vendors demonstrate working code, not slides
- Evaluation based on user experience, technical viability, and performance against targets
- State retains IP from all prototypes

**Key Roles:**
- **E3 CDD:** Decision authority and problem ownership
- **TMO Challenge Manager:** Process coordination and vendor logistics
- **ODI Advisor:** Human-centered design principles

> **For detailed procedures:** See [RFI² Operational Guide](../toolkit/rfi2-guide.md) for phase checklists, team composition, evaluation criteria, and example problem statements.

## B.2 Fellowship Program Design

**Purpose:** Build a continuous pipeline of modernization leaders through immersive 6-month cohorts.

**Program Structure:**

The Governor's Innovation Fellowship develops 60 leaders annually across 3 cohorts of 20. Fellows gain enterprise perspective through cross-agency exposure while delivering real impact through department embedding.

**Five Program Components:**

| Component | Duration | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Foundational Bootcamp** | Weeks 1-2 | Executive communication, innovation methods, government landscape |
| **Leadership Breadth** | Months 1-3 | Listening sessions with 8-10 departments; executive shadowing |
| **Innovation Training** | Months 1-4 | Human-centered design, prototyping, change management |
| **Department Embedding** | Full 6 months | Full-time placement on real priority project outside home agency |
| **Group Initiatives** | Full 6 months | Teams of 5 tackle cross-agency challenges; present to Cabinet |

**Key Design Principles:**

1. **Real Work:** Fellows own actual business priorities with measurable outcomes—not "make work" projects
2. **Cross-Pollination:** Placement outside home agency builds enterprise perspective and relationships
3. **Sustainability:** Each Fellow works with a department surrogate who continues the work post-Fellowship
4. **Cohort Power:** Peer learning and mutual support create lasting professional networks

**Mentorship Model:**
- Departmental Supervisor (day-to-day)
- Home Agency Mentor (career guidance)
- Cohort Peer (mutual accountability)

**Graduation Pathway:** Senior Fellows remain engaged as mentors, advisors, or transition to permanent E3 positions.

## B.3 Breakthrough Fund Sustainability Model

**Purpose:** Demonstrate how the fund becomes self-sustaining through reinvestment of realized savings.

*This section is retained in full as it provides essential strategic context for the funding model.*

---

**Worked Example: Business Licensing Automation**

**Step 1: Project Delivers Measurable Savings**

A Breakthrough Fund investment of $3M modernizes business licensing across three agencies:
- Processing time reduced from 45 days to 3 days
- Staffing reduced from 20 FTE to 8 FTE through automation
- Staff reassigned to higher-value work (compliance, outreach)

**Savings Calculation:**
- 12 FTE positions no longer needed for processing
- Average loaded cost per FTE: $100,000/year
- **Annual cost reduction: $1.2M**

---

**Step 2: Department Budget Adjusted**

Following validation of sustained savings (typically 1 fiscal year of demonstrated performance):
- Department baseline budget reduced by $1.2M
- Reduction implemented in subsequent fiscal year
- Staff reassignment or attrition managed through normal HR processes

---

**Step 3: Fixed 25% Diverted to Breakthrough Fund**

Per policy, 25% of realized savings flow back to the Breakthrough Fund:
- 25% of $1.2M = **$300K diverted to Breakthrough Fund annually**
- 75% of $1.2M = **$900K returns to General Fund**

This continues for the life of the project (typically 5-7 years before system refresh required).

---

**Step 4: Reinvestment Creates Next Generation Projects**

The $300K annual contribution funds new modernization:

**Portfolio Effect:**

| Year | Active Projects | Annual Savings Generated | 25% to Fund | Cumulative Fund Growth |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | 5 pilots | $2M | $500K | $500K |
| 2 | 10 projects | $6M | $1.5M | $2M |
| 3 | 18 projects | $12M | $3M | $5M |
| 4 | 25 projects | $20M | $5M | $10M |
| 5 | 30 projects | $30M | $7.5M | $17.5M |

---

**Self-Sustainability Threshold**

The fund becomes self-sustaining when annual reinvestment inflows equal or exceed annual investment needs:

- **Target annual investment capacity:** $15-20M (10-15 new projects per year)
- **Required annual savings generation:** $60-80M (to produce $15-20M at 25%)
- **Estimated time to self-sustainability:** 5-7 years from initial $100M capitalization

At self-sustainability:
- Private sector partners can exit or continue
- General Fund contribution no longer required
- Fund operates as permanent modernization engine

---

**Risk Factors and Mitigation**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Projects don't deliver savings | Stage-gate process kills underperformers early |
| Savings not captured in budget | TMO tracks savings; automatic budget adjustment policy |
| Departments resist budget reduction | Savings reinvested in department priorities; not purely extractive |
| Political pressure to redirect funds | Statutory protection for 25% diversion; transparent reporting |

---

## B.4 Labor Relations Framework

**Purpose:** Ensure modernization strengthens the workforce rather than displacing it.

**Guiding Principles:**

1. **No Layoffs from Modernization:** Efficiency gains redirect staff to higher-value work, not unemployment
2. **Upskilling Over Displacement:** Training programs prepare workers for evolving roles
3. **Early Engagement:** Labor consulted before, not after, modernization decisions
4. **Transparency:** Clear communication about timelines, impacts, and opportunities
5. **Shared Benefits:** Productivity gains benefit both service delivery and workforce

**No-Layoff Commitment Enforcement:**

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Monitoring** | TMO tracks all separations; flags any coded as "modernization-related" |
| **Escalation** | Departments must exhaust reassignment options before any exception |
| **Consequences** | Departments violating commitment lose Breakthrough Fund access |
| **Employee Remedy** | Affected employees may appeal to CalHR; reinstatement if improper |

**Reassignment Priorities:**
1. Within same department to higher-value work
2. To growing functions (data governance, customer service, compliance)
3. To other departments with matching skill needs
4. To new positions created by modernization

**Union Engagement:**
- Quarterly TMO briefings to statewide union leadership
- Union representatives invited to Breakthrough Fund review committees
- Advance consultation on workflow changes affecting bargaining unit work

**Success Metrics:**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Involuntary separations from modernization | 0 |
| Employees successfully reassigned | 100% |
| Training completion rate | 95%+ |
| Union grievances related to modernization | <5/year statewide |

> **For detailed procedures:** See [Labor Relations Guide](../archive/b4-labor-relations-detail.md) for workforce transition timelines, classification considerations, and escalation protocols.

*Note: Labor relations detail remains in archive as it is primarily HR reference material.*

## B.5 Citizen Journey Teams Framework

**Purpose:** Redesign government services around citizen life events rather than agency boundaries.

**The Problem:**

Citizens experience life events (starting a business, having a baby, disaster recovery) that require navigating multiple agencies. Each agency optimizes its own transaction, but no one owns the citizen's overall experience.

**The Solution:**

Citizen Journey Teams bring E3 leaders, SMEs, and Fellows from relevant agencies together to redesign experiences around complete journeys—creating seamless integrated services.

| Traditional Approach | Journey Team Approach |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Citizen navigates multiple agencies | Single coordinated experience |
| Each agency owns a transaction | Team owns the outcome |
| Data stays in silos | Shared data (with consent) |
| Success = processing volume | Success = citizen satisfaction |

**Team Structure:**

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Executive Sponsor** | Undersecretary from lead agency; champions and removes barriers |
| **Journey Lead** | Senior Fellow or CDD; day-to-day coordination and delivery |
| **Agency Representatives** | CDDs from each participating agency; expertise and commitment |
| **Design Lead** | ODI; user research and service design |
| **Technical Lead** | TMO; API integration and data sharing |

**Operating Phases:**

| Phase | Duration | Objective |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Formation | Month 1 | Charter team, secure agency commitments |
| Discovery | Months 2-3 | Map citizen experience, quantify pain points |
| Design | Months 4-5 | Co-create solutions, validate with testing |
| Build | Months 6-12 | Implement incrementally, measure impact |
| Iterate | Ongoing | Track outcomes, continuously improve |

**Cross-Agency Accountability:**

- Written charter with E3 leader signatures from each agency
- Sponsor escalation path to Governor's Office
- E3 leader OKRs include journey team performance
- Public dashboard tracks journey metrics

**Success Metrics:**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Journey completion time | 50% reduction |
| Agency touchpoints required | 60% reduction |
| Digital completion rate | 80%+ |
| Citizen satisfaction (NPS) | +20 points |

**Priority Journeys (Year 1):**
- **New Business Formation:** Secretary of State + FTB, EDD, ABC (100K+ businesses/year)
- **Disaster Recovery:** CalOES + HCD, CDI, EDD (critical resilience)

> **For complete operating procedures:** See [Journey Teams Operating Guide](../toolkit/journey-teams-guide.md) for charter template, phase activities, discovery methods, and accountability mechanisms.
