## Appendix F: Budget and Financial Models

> **Cost Estimate Disclaimer:** The budget estimates in this appendix are preliminary planning figures based on comparable positions, programs, and initiatives. Actual costs will vary based on final position classifications, labor negotiations, market conditions, and implementation decisions. These estimates should be refined during detailed budget development with CalHR, Department of Finance, and agency budget offices.

**Inflation Adjustment Guidance:**

All figures are presented in 2025 current dollars. For multi-year budget planning:

| Cost Category | Recommended Annual Adjustment | Basis |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Personnel (salaries, benefits) | 3.0% | State employee COLA patterns |
| Vendor/contractor costs | 2.5% | Technology services inflation |
| Infrastructure/cloud services | 1.5% | Technology cost deflation trend |

*Example: Year 3 personnel costs of $10M in 2025 dollars = $10.6M in 2028 nominal dollars (3% annually). Apply adjustments when developing Budget Change Proposals and legislative appropriation requests.*

### G.3 Change Management: The ADKAR Model

Government digital transformation has an 80% failure rate, primarily due to cultural resistance. Technology is only 30% of the challenge; people and process represent 70%.

**ADKAR Framework:**
- **A**wareness of need for change
- **D**esire to support and participate
- **K**nowledge of how to change
- **A**bility to implement change
- **R**einforcement to sustain change

**Application:**

**Awareness:**
- Executive communications explaining "why modernize"
- Data on current state challenges (system age, costs, citizen satisfaction)
- Vision of future state benefits
- Regular town halls and listening sessions

**Desire:**
- Involve staff in co-design of solutions
- Address "what's in it for me"
- Celebrate early adopters and champions
- No-blame experimentation zones
- Union engagement and collaboration

**Knowledge:**
- Comprehensive training programs (Digital Accelerators, CalAcademy)
- Job aids and documentation
- Peer mentoring and communities of practice

**Ability:**
- Hands-on practice in sandbox environments
- Coaching and support during transition
- Protected learning time (20% of work hours)
- Gradual rollouts with support

**Reinforcement:**
- Recognition and rewards for adoption
- Performance incentives tied to modernization outcomes
- Ongoing support and continuous improvement
- Integration into performance evaluations

### G.4 Resistance Management

**Common Sources of Resistance:**
- Fear of job loss or role change
- Comfort with status quo
- Previous failed change attempts
- Lack of trust in leadership
- Insufficient training or support
- Unclear benefits

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Transparent communication about job security
- Retraining and reskilling programs
- Early involvement in design
- Small wins demonstrating value
- Leadership visibility and commitment
- Adequate support resources

### G.5 Communication Strategy

**Audiences:**
- Executive leadership
- Department directors and managers
- Frontline staff
- Labor unions
- Legislature
- Citizens/stakeholders
- Media

**Channels:**
- Town halls and listening sessions
- Internal newsletters and emails
- Intranet and collaboration platforms
- Training events
- Success story publications
- Social media and press releases

**Messaging:**
- Consistent narrative about "why" and "what"
- Balanced reporting (successes and challenges)
- Recognition of individuals and teams
- Connection to mission and values
- Data-driven progress updates

### G.6 Risk Mitigation Matrix

The following table identifies key risks to the modernization initiative and mitigation strategies:

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Independent Office legislation delayed** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Early stakeholder engagement, concurrent legislative and planning work, interim steering committee maintaining momentum if needed |
| **Resistance to change from entrenched interests** | HIGH | HIGH | Protected learning time, no-blame experimentation zones, union engagement early, quick wins demonstrating value, Readiness Assessment identifying concerns |
| **Political transitions disrupting momentum** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Cross-branch Independent Office structure, bipartisan legislative framing, embedded governance surviving transitions, early wins demonstrating value across political spectrum |
| **Vendor dependencies and lock-in** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Open standards requirements, API-first architecture, modular contracting $15M cap, competitive procurement, avoid proprietary platforms |
| **Fellowship talent retention challenges** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Preferential hiring pathways, executive duty statement integration, ongoing SME network engagement, competitive advancement opportunities, alumni network maintaining connections |
| **Low-readiness departments failing E3 deployment** | MEDIUM | LOW | Readiness Assessment-based deployment sequencing, capacity building before E3 assignment, Tier 3-4 departments receive intensive training before projects, realistic timelines |
| **GovOps coordination challenges across agencies** | MEDIUM | LOW | Clear TMO charter, adequate staffing, Governor's Office support, Statewide E3 Council peer accountability, respect for agency autonomy |
| **Breakthrough Fund project failures** | LOW | MEDIUM | Portfolio diversification (70/20/10 risk allocation), stage-gate governance stopping failing projects early, metrics-driven decisions, no sunk cost fallacy |
