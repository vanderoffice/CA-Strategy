## 1. Strategic Foundation

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes the vision, mission, and guiding principles for California's modernization, explains why government lacks natural efficiency mechanisms, and describes how ODI and GovOps serve as foundational partners.

### 1.1 Vision Statement

California state government operates with the efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation of leading organizations while maintaining public sector values of equity, transparency, and accessibility. Every Californian experiences government services that are digital-first, user-centered, and seamlessly integrated across agencies—delivered through empowered teams using modern tools, shared data, artificial intelligence, and continuous improvement practices that make government as responsive as the best private sector organizations.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

Transform California's government operations through the Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model, creating institutional forcing mechanisms that drive continuous improvement, technological modernization, and excellence in public service delivery. By establishing empowered leadership positions, independent data governance, continuous talent development, and sustainable funding mechanisms, California will demonstrate that government can deliver exceptional outcomes while remaining accountable, transparent, and equitable.

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

**Citizen-Centric Design:**
Every technology investment and process change must clearly improve citizen experiences. User research, accessibility testing, and satisfaction measurement inform all decisions. Services should be organized around life experiences—not organizational charts. Government exists to serve people, and every system, process, and policy should reflect that fundamental purpose.

**Evidence-Based Decision Making:**
Data, metrics, and rigorous evaluation guide resource allocation, project prioritization, and performance assessment. The Readiness Assessment framework ensures strategic deployment of resources based on department preparedness, reducing risk and maximizing probability of success. Transparency in both successes and failures enables organizational learning. What gets measured gets managed; what gets shared gets improved.

**Actual Authority:**
Modernization leaders and governance bodies must have real decision-making power over technology investments, data sharing mandates, procurement approvals, and performance accountability—not merely advisory roles. The Independent Office of State Data Governance structure and the E3 Undersecretary and E3 Chief Deputy Director positions proposed in this plan provide enforceable authority that transcends traditional agency boundaries. Without authority, modernization becomes optional; with authority, it becomes inevitable.

**Readiness-Based Deployment:**
Not all departments are equally prepared for modernization. Strategic use of the Readiness Assessment framework ensures resources flow to departments positioned for success, creating early wins that build momentum rather than premature failures that generate resistance. This principle recognizes that transformation requires capability, not just commitment.

**Open and Collaborative:**
California's modernization serves as an open-source model for peer states. Collaboration with private sector partners, academic institutions, ODI expertise, and other governments accelerates progress. Breakthrough Fund partners co-invest and co-learn, creating replicable patterns applicable beyond California. Open innovation multiplies impact.

**Equity and Inclusion:**
Digital transformation must not create new barriers for underserved populations. Multi-language support, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum), digital literacy programs, and alternative service channels ensure universal access. Services must be designed with—not just for—the communities they serve. Technology should reduce disparities, not amplify them.

**Sustainable and Scalable:**
Solutions must work at California's scale (40 million residents, 170 departments, 230,000+ employees) and remain maintainable over decades. Avoid bespoke systems and proprietary vendor lock-in. Prefer cheap, scalable, self-supportable innovative solutions over giant monolithic systems that create long-term dependencies and technical debt. Sustainability means both financial and operational longevity.

**Security and Privacy by Design:**
Cybersecurity, data privacy (CCPA compliance), and ethical AI use are embedded from project inception, not added retrospectively. Every data sharing agreement, every API, every system must meet stringent security standards appropriate to data sensitivity. Trust is California's most valuable asset—and most fragile.

### 1.4 The Core Problem

Private sector organizations face market-driven pressure to optimize operations. Poor efficiency leads to higher costs, reduced competitiveness, declining revenue, and potential business failure. This forcing mechanism drives continuous improvement, innovation, and accountability. Companies that fail to adapt cease to exist.

Government agencies operate without this pressure. Budget allocations continue regardless of operational efficiency. Services remain monopolistic—citizens cannot choose alternative providers. Technology systems persist decades beyond useful life because replacement lacks urgency. Poor performance rarely triggers consequences; risk-averse cultures prioritize stability over improvement. The incentive structure rewards maintaining the status quo.

**Measurable Consequences (2024-2025 Data):**

- **Legacy System Crisis:** Legacy systems consume 70-80% of IT budgets, leaving 20-30% for innovation, modernization, and new capabilities. The average age of critical government systems exceeds 25 years, with some mainframe systems dating to the 1970s and early 1980s. These systems require increasingly scarce technical expertise (COBOL, Fortran, AS/400) and face mounting failure risks.

- **Data Fragmentation:** Over 400 independent systems across state government prevent information sharing, forcing citizens to provide the same information multiple times to different agencies. Data sharing agreements take 12-18 months on average to negotiate and execute, creating barriers to cross-agency collaboration and integrated service delivery.

- **Procurement Delays:** Traditional procurement cycles average 12-18 months from requirement definition to contract award, delaying technology adoption by years and compounding costs. Large monolithic contracts create vendor lock-in, reduce competition, and concentrate risk in single points of failure.

- **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities:** Outdated infrastructure exposes citizen data to increasing threats. Systems lacking modern security controls (multi-factor authentication, encryption at rest and in transit, continuous monitoring, zero-trust architecture) create organizational risk and compliance challenges.

- **Workforce Skills Gap:** 33% of government workers have low or no digital skills despite 92% of jobs now requiring them. Compensation gaps of 20-40% versus private sector drive technical talent attrition, particularly in high-demand specialties (cloud architecture, data science, cybersecurity, DevOps). The average age of IT workers in government exceeds 50, with retirement wave creating knowledge loss.

- **Service Delivery Gaps:** Citizens must navigate fragmented services, visit multiple agencies for related needs, and interact with systems designed around bureaucratic structures rather than user needs. Multi-language support and accessibility compliance remain inconsistent.

- **Innovation Deficit:** Risk-averse cultures penalize failure more than they reward innovation. Experimentation requires extensive approvals; pilots struggle to reach production; "not invented here" syndrome limits knowledge sharing across agencies. First-mover disadvantage discourages initiative.

- **AI Readiness Gap:** Artificial intelligence is transforming service delivery across sectors, yet California state government lacks the foundations to adopt AI effectively. Fragmented data prevents AI systems from accessing comprehensive information. Outdated infrastructure cannot support modern AI platforms. Absent governance frameworks create risk of inconsistent or inequitable AI deployment. Without deliberate preparation, the state will fall further behind private sector capabilities and miss opportunities to improve efficiency and citizen service.

California cannot rely on organic improvement. These structural problems require structural solutions. The state must deliberately create the forcing mechanism that drives efficiency and effectiveness through institutional design.

### 1.5 The Office of Data and Innovation: Pioneer and Partner

The **Office of Data and Innovation (ODI)** has pioneered the approaches this plan scales statewide. ODI provides innovation methods (CalInnovate), training infrastructure (CalAcademy), technical standards (California Design System, API standards), and data governance leadership.

**ODI's Role in This Plan:**

The proposed E3 Operational Model would create empowered champions at every agency who can mandate adoption of ODI-developed tools, practices, and standards. ODI would transition from optional service provider to essential enabler:

- **Innovation Methods:** CalInnovate approaches become standard practice for all modernization initiatives
- **Training Infrastructure:** CalAcademy becomes foundational training for all E3 Undersecretaries, E3 Chief Deputy Directors, Fellows, and data governance teams
- **Technical Standards:** ODI-developed API standards, data sharing templates, and design systems become mandatory rather than voluntary
- **Partnership Model:** E3 Undersecretaries and E3 Chief Deputy Directors allocate budget for ODI services and mandate department participation in ODI programs
- **Performance Analytics:** ODI expertise supports TMO performance measurement and dashboard development

**ODI Collaboration with E3 Leadership:**

| Service | ODI Role | E3 Undersecretary/CDD Role | Governance |
|---------|----------|----------------------------|------------|
| **CalInnovate** | Deliver service design sprints | Mandate participation; fund projects | E3 Undersecretary sponsors each engagement |
| **CalAcademy** | Develop curriculum; deliver training | Require completion for E3 staff | TMO tracks completion rates |
| **Design System** | Maintain California Design System | Mandate use for citizen services | CDT enforces compliance at procurement |
| **Data Standards** | Develop templates, schemas | Adopt and implement | Independent Office reviews compliance |
| **Analytics Support** | Provide methodology, tools | Execute departmental analytics | E3 Chief Deputy Director requests; ODI prioritizes |

**Decision Authority:**
- **Mandatory Services:** CalAcademy training, Design System compliance, API standards — E3 Undersecretaries and E3 Chief Deputy Directors must require these
- **Optional Services:** CalInnovate engagements, analytics consulting — E3 Undersecretaries and E3 Chief Deputy Directors request based on need; ODI prioritizes based on capacity and impact
- **Conflict Resolution:** If ODI and E3 leaders disagree on approach/priority, escalate to TMO Director then GovOps Secretary

### 1.6 Government Operations Agency: Coordination Hub

The **Government Operations Agency (GovOps)** serves as California's management and efficiency agency. GovOps houses the expertise in technology (CDT), innovation (ODI), and workforce management (CalHR) that all agencies need.

**How This Plan Expands GovOps Coordination Capability:**

This Enterprise Modernization Plan establishes a framework that enables GovOps to coordinate statewide efficiency and effectiveness initiatives while respecting the autonomy of other cabinet agencies:

**Transformation Management Office (TMO) within GovOps:**
- Provides centralized coordination, portfolio management, performance tracking, and support services
- TMO supports (but does not control) E3 Undersecretaries across all agencies
- Creates visibility and accountability without exercising direct authority over other agencies

**Statewide E3 Council:**
- Convened through Governor's Office with TMO providing staff support
- Brings together all E3 Undersecretaries from all agencies for coordination, alignment, and peer learning
- Coordination, not command-and-control

**Leveraging GovOps Expertise Statewide:**
- **CDT** provides technology standards, cybersecurity guidance, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise architecture services
- **ODI** provides innovation methods, human-centered design, CalAcademy training, and DIF funding partnerships
- **CalHR** provides workforce planning, classification support for data governance teams, and change management guidance
- **DGS** supports procurement innovation, modular contracting, and facilities management

**CDT-E3 Governance Relationship:**

| Domain | CDT Role | E3 Undersecretary/CDD Role | Decision Authority |
|--------|----------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Standards** | Develop and maintain SIMM/SAM | Implement within projects | CDT sets standards; E3 leaders comply |
| **Security** | Set policies, operate SOC, provide guidance | Implement within departments | CDT policies binding; E3 leaders execute |
| **Cloud** | Manage infrastructure, negotiate enterprise contracts | Select services for projects | CDT provides options; E3 leaders select within approved services |
| **Architecture** | Define enterprise architecture principles | Design solutions within principles | CDT reviews $2M+ projects; E3 leaders own design |
| **Procurement** | Technical review for IT procurements | Lead procurement process | Joint review for major procurements ($5M+) |

**Dispute Resolution:** If E3 Undersecretary and CDT disagree on technical approach, escalate to GovOps Secretary. CDT security policies are non-negotiable; architecture and cloud decisions allow flexibility within standards.

### 2.2 E3 Undersecretary Positions (Strategic Leadership and Agency Coordination)

**Position Overview:**
This proposal recommends creating **E3 Undersecretaries** (Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness) who would operate at the Agency level, reporting directly to Agency Secretaries while coordinating statewide efforts through the Transformation Management Office and Statewide E3 Council. These positions would hold explicit authority over technology modernization, business process optimization, data governance, and performance management within their agencies.

**Why This Position Matters:**
Without E3 Undersecretaries, modernization efforts fragment across departments with no strategic coordination. Individual departments optimize locally but create incompatibilities system-wide. E3 Undersecretaries provide agency-level strategic direction, ensure cross-department interoperability, allocate resources based on enterprise priorities rather than political influence, and create forcing function for consistent progress. They are the difference between coordinated transformation and chaotic fragmentation.

For sample position descriptions and duty statements, see [Template A.1: E3 Position Description](appendices/06-templates.md#a1-e3-position-description-template).

These would not be advisory or coordinator roles. E3 Undersecretaries would have authority to approve major technology investments, mandate cross-department data sharing, redirect resources to strategic initiatives, and hold E3 Chief Deputy Directors accountable for results. They would serve as the primary interface between their agencies and both ODI and the Office of State Data Governance, ensuring proven methods and mandatory standards are adopted at scale.

**Deployment Strategy:**

*Recommendation: Begin with 8 E3 Undersecretaries covering the highest-priority agencies, with expansion to 12 based on demonstrated results and Readiness Assessment improvements.*

### 2.3 E3 Chief Deputy Director Positions (Operational Execution and Department Transformation)

**Position Overview:**
This proposal recommends creating **E3 Chief Deputy Directors** (Chief Deputy Directors for Efficiency and Effectiveness) who would operate within departments, reporting to Department Directors while coordinating with agency-level E3 Undersecretaries and TMO. These positions would hold operational responsibility for modernization execution, managing cross-functional teams including data governance staff and embedded Innovation Fellows.

**Why This Position Matters:**
Department Directors manage complex operations with competing priorities: service delivery, regulatory compliance, budget constraints, legislative mandates, and stakeholder relations. Modernization often falls to the bottom of priority lists without dedicated leadership. E3 Chief Deputy Directors provide persistent focus on transformation, bridging the gap between strategic vision (E3 Undersecretary level) and operational reality (department programs and systems). They translate modernization strategy into tangible improvements citizens experience.

E3 Chief Deputy Directors are hands-on leaders who understand both technology and domain operations. They manage project portfolios, lead business process improvement initiatives, deploy new technologies, ensure data quality, and deliver measurable service improvements. They are the change agents embedded in department operations.

**Deployment Strategy:**

*Recommendation: Deploy 30 E3 Chief Deputy Directors (E3 CDDs) initially to departments with highest readiness and citizen impact, with expansion to 40 based on results.*

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-12):** Deploy to 10 highest-readiness departments (Tier 1 Readiness scores) to establish early wins and demonstrate value
- **Phase 2 (Months 13-24):** Expand to 20 additional departments (Tier 2 with targeted capability building to address specific gaps)
- **Phase 3 (Months 25-36):** Evaluate results and expand to remaining high-impact departments (final deployment of 30-40 total positions based on demonstrated value and Readiness Assessment scores)

**Comprehensive Responsibilities:**

**Operational Execution and Project Delivery (30% of role):**
- Execute department modernization roadmap aligned with agency strategy and Readiness Assessment improvement targets
- Manage project portfolio using TMO portfolio management system and stage-gate governance framework
- Deliver quarterly milestones and performance targets; escalate risks early to Undersecretary and Department Director
- Coordinate with TMO on dependencies and cross-department initiatives; participate in Communities of Practice
- Ensure host department provides surrogates/delegates for Innovation Fellows, supporting business continuity and sustainable succession planning
- Track budget and schedule performance; recommend course corrections or project cancellations when necessary

**Technology Implementation and Modernization (25% of role):**
- Oversee legacy system migrations using strangler pattern and incremental modernization approaches
- Implement API integrations connecting department systems to agency service mesh; publish APIs to agency catalog
- Deploy cloud infrastructure; migrate applications following hybrid cloud strategy with critical system redundancy

- Ensure cybersecurity controls and compliance appropriate to data sensitivity (FISMA, NIST 800-53, SIMM 5300)
- Partner with CDT on infrastructure and security; partner with ODI on innovation pilots and service design

**Business Process Optimization and Automation (20% of role):**
- Conduct process mapping and identify automation opportunities using ODI CalInnovate methods
- Implement digital workflows replacing manual processes; prefer cheap, scalable solutions over enterprise software
- Deploy automation solutions for document processing, case management, and routine tasks (RPA, workflow engines)
- Measure process efficiency improvements (cycle time reduction, cost per transaction, error rates, citizen satisfaction)
- Partner with ODI CalInnovate team on human-centered design initiatives and service transformation

**Data Management and Governance (15% of role):**
- Implement Independent Office data governance policies and standards within department context
- Lead department data governance teams (blended scientists/engineers + data specialists)
- Ensure data quality and master data alignment with statewide definitions; track data quality KPIs
- Execute data sharing agreements with partner agencies; reduce negotiation time from 12-18 months to 4-8 weeks for standard scenarios using templates
- Deploy analytics and reporting capabilities; democratize data access for evidence-based decision making

**Authorities:**
- Approve project plans and budgets within delegated limits (typically up to $2M)
- Direct staff assigned to transformation initiatives including data governance teams, project managers, analysts
- Recommend vendor selections and contract awards to Department Director and Undersecretary
- Escalate barriers to Undersecretary, Department Director, or TMO as appropriate
- Mandate ODI CalAcademy training completion for modernization team members

**Decision Authority Matrix (Undersecretary vs. Chief Deputy Director):**

| Decision Type | Under $500K | $500K-$2M | $2M-$5M | Over $5M |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Project Approval** | CDD approves | CDD approves; Undersecretary notified | CDD recommends; Undersecretary approves | Undersecretary + TMO review |
| **Vendor Selection** | CDD approves | CDD approves; Undersecretary notified | CDD recommends; Undersecretary approves | Undersecretary + CDT consultation |
| **Architecture Decisions** | CDD approves (CDT standards apply) | CDD approves; Undersecretary notified | Undersecretary approves; CDT consultation | Undersecretary + CDT mandatory review |
| **Data Sharing Agreements** | CDD approves (Template 1-2) | CDD recommends; Undersecretary approves (Template 2-3) | Undersecretary approves (Template 3) | Independent Office review (Template 4) |

**Escalation Path:** CDD → Undersecretary → TMO → GovOps Secretary (for cross-agency conflicts)

**Qualifications:**
- **Preferential Hiring:** Completion of Governor's Innovation Fellowship with successful project delivery and positive evaluations
- **Alternative:** 7+ years technology program/project management experience with government or equivalent complex stakeholder environments
- Hands-on technical credibility (architecture, development, infrastructure, data) enabling informed decision-making and vendor oversight
- Proven ability to deliver complex initiatives on time and budget; portfolio of successful transformations
- Strong communication and change management skills; ability to build consensus across resistant constituencies and skeptical stakeholders

### 2.4 Transformation Management Office (TMO)

**Purpose and Strategic Importance:**
The TMO provides centralized coordination, portfolio management, performance tracking, and support services essential to the entire modernization initiative. Without TMO, modernization efforts risk becoming fragmented silos where well-intentioned leaders pursue similar solutions in parallel, wasting resources and foregoing economies of scale.

**Why TMO Matters - The Case for Centralized Coordination:**

Government agencies tend toward independent operation. Decentralization has benefits (autonomy, customization, accountability) but also costs. Without coordination:
- **Duplicated Effort:** Multiple agencies build similar solutions independently (identity management, payment processing, document management)
- **Incompatibility:** Independently developed systems cannot interoperate, preventing data sharing and integrated service delivery
- **Missed Learning:** Successful innovations remain siloed; failures repeat across agencies
- **Resource Waste:** Agencies compete for same vendors, driving up costs; cannot achieve volume discounts
- **Invisible Dependencies:** Projects unknowingly depend on other projects, causing cascading delays when dependencies aren't managed

TMO prevents these pathologies by:
- **Creating Visibility:** Single source of truth for all modernization initiatives statewide; everyone knows what everyone else is doing
- **Managing Dependencies:** Identifying where projects rely on each other; preventing conflicts; enabling sequencing
- **Enabling Reuse:** Capturing what works; packaging for adoption by other departments; preventing reinvention
- **Providing Early Warning:** Detecting troubled projects before they fail catastrophically; enabling intervention
- **Building Community:** Connecting E3 leaders (E3 Undersecretaries and E3 Chief Deputy Directors) for peer learning, mutual support, and collaborative problem-solving

**Organizational Placement:**
- **Reports to:** Government Operations Agency Secretary
- **Coordinates with:** Statewide E3 Council, ODI, CDT, Office of State Data Governance, Department of Finance
- **Supports:** All E3 Undersecretaries and E3 Chief Deputy Directors across all agencies

**Staffing:**
- **Director:** Executive leadership, external representation, agency Secretary interface, Statewide E3 Council staff support
- **Portfolio Management Team (5-7 staff):** Project pipeline tracking, dependency management, stage-gate reviews, budget/schedule performance monitoring
- **Performance Analytics Team (3-5 staff):** KPI tracking, dashboard production, trend analysis, evaluation, public reporting
- **Change Management Team (3-5 staff):** Training coordination (with CalAcademy), communication support, culture change initiatives, stakeholder engagement
- **Innovation Team (3-5 staff):** Fellowship program management, Breakthrough Fund coordination, pilot programs, sandbox operation

### 2.5 California Innovation Council Interface

In December 2025, the Governor established the California Innovation Council with four working groups to guide AI integration and technology policy across state government. The E3 Operational Model provides the execution capacity for council policy recommendations through designated liaisons.

**Council Working Group Alignment:**

## 3. Independent Office of State Data Governance

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes the Independent Office of State Data Governance with cross-branch authority, including board composition, responsibilities, and standardized data sharing agreement templates.

### 3.1 Constitutional Model and Precedent

The Independent Office of State Data Governance follows California's Little Hoover Commission model: cross-branch appointments, staggered terms, statutory authority, and independence from any single agency.

**Why Independence Matters:**
- E3 leaders need enforceable data sharing authority, not just coordination roles
- Single-agency governance (e.g., within GovOps) lacks legitimacy across other cabinet agencies
- Legislative/judicial branches require data too; executive-only governance excludes them
- Political transitions shouldn't reset data governance; institutional continuity essential

*Note: Establishing the Independent Office of State Data Governance requires enabling legislation. The cross-branch appointment structure and binding authority outlined below cannot be achieved through executive order alone. This recommendation assumes legislative partnership and should be developed in coordination with the Legislature.*

**Legislative Strategy and Timeline:**

| Phase | Timeline | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Draft Development** | Months 1-3 | Develop model legislation with Governor's office and legislative counsel; stakeholder consultation |
| **Legislative Introduction** | Months 4-6 | Bill introduction; committee hearings; amendments |
| **Passage Target** | Months 7-10 | Floor votes; conference committee if needed; Governor signature |
| **Board Formation** | Months 11-14 | Appointment process; initial board meetings; hire Executive Director |
| **Operational Launch** | Months 15-18 | Office staffing; initial standards development; begin data sharing framework |

**Interim Governance (If Legislation Delayed):**

If enabling legislation is not enacted by Month 12, the following interim structure will operate under executive authority:

1. **California Interagency Data Council (CIDC):** Executive-branch-only body convened by GovOps Secretary with representation from all cabinet agencies. Limited to executive branch coordination; cannot bind legislative/judicial branches.

2. **Interim Powers:** CIDC can develop draft standards, pilot data sharing agreements between executive agencies, and build technical infrastructure. All work designed to transition seamlessly to Independent Office once established.

3. **Limitations Acknowledged:** Interim structure lacks cross-branch authority and binding enforcement. Data sharing with courts, Legislature, and external entities will require case-by-case negotiation until Independent Office established.

4. **Advocacy Continuation:** TMO and E3 leaders continue legislative advocacy; provide progress reports demonstrating value of data sharing to build support for full authorization.

**Transition from CIDC to Independent Office:**

When enabling legislation is enacted, the transition process ensures continuity of data governance work:

| Transition Element | Timeline | Process |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| **Board Appointments** | 60 days post-enactment | Appointing authorities nominate board members; Governor convenes first meeting |
| **CIDC Asset Transfer** | 90 days | Draft standards, pilot agreements, technical infrastructure transfer to Independent Office; CIDC dissolved |
| **Staff Transition** | 90-120 days | CIDC technical staff offered positions with Independent Office; hiring for additional capacity |
| **Ongoing Work Continuity** | Immediate | All active data sharing pilots continue without interruption; agreements signed under CIDC authority remain valid |
| **Cross-Branch Expansion** | 120 days | Independent Office begins engaging judicial and legislative branches for cross-branch data governance |

**Key Principles:**
- No disruption to active data sharing projects
- CIDC-developed standards become foundation for Independent Office standards (refined with cross-branch input)
- Technical infrastructure investments (APIs, data catalogs) remain operational
- Lessons learned from CIDC pilots inform Independent Office policies

This transition approach ensures that interim progress accelerates rather than delays full implementation.

### 3.2 Board Composition (9 Members Minimum)

**Required Seats:**
1. Governor appointment #1
2. Governor appointment #2
3. Senate Rules Committee appointment
4. Assembly Speaker appointment
5. Judicial Council appointment
6. UC Regents representative
7. CSU Board representative
8. **Public seat (REQUIRED)** - citizen perspective, accountability
9. **Breakthrough partner / digital industry representative (REQUIRED)** - private sector expertise, co-learning

**Senior Technical Advisor Requirement:**
Each board seat must have an assigned Senior Technical Advisor who provides technical expertise, reviews standards, and advises their appointing member. These advisors should be experienced technology professionals at a senior level (e.g., senior architects, engineering managers, data science leads, or equivalent)—not necessarily holding a formal "Chief" or "Officer" title. This ensures board decisions are technically sound and implementable while allowing flexibility in how appointing authorities staff this advisory function.

**Term Structure:**
- Staggered 3-year terms
- Survives administration transitions
- Cross-branch legitimacy

### 3.3 Authority and Responsibilities

**Binding Powers:**
- Set statewide data standards (schemas, formats, quality rules)
- Approve/mandate data sharing frameworks
- Establish statewide AI governance standards including approved use cases, human oversight requirements, bias testing protocols, and transparency guidelines
- Convene all branches for policy development
- Enforce compliance through budget/procurement mechanisms

**Key Functions:**
- Develop statewide data architecture that enables AI adoption across agencies
- Resolve inter-agency data disputes
- Protect privacy while enabling sharing and responsible AI use
- Maintain registry of approved AI applications and their oversight requirements
- Annual reporting to Legislature on data governance and AI deployment

**Authority Delegation and Coordination:**

The data governance structure operates at three levels with clearly defined decision authority:

| Decision Level | Authority | Scope | Examples |
|----------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Department-Level** | Chief Deputy Director + Data Governance Team | Public data exchange within agency; non-sensitive operational data sharing | DMV shares aggregate vehicle data with Air Resources Board (Template 1) |
| **Agency-Level** | Undersecretary for E&E | Confidential data with limited PII within agency; cross-department coordination | Health and Human Services shares licensing data between departments (Template 2) |
| **Cross-Agency / Sensitive** | Independent Office Board | Sensitive PII, cross-agency sensitive data, cross-branch sharing | Corrections shares inmate data with Social Services (Template 3); Executive shares data with Judicial Council (Template 4) |

**Escalation and Dispute Resolution:**

When agency-level data governance councils disagree on data sharing terms or when data sharing crosses agency boundaries with sensitive data categories, the Independent Office provides binding arbitration:

1. **Agency-internal disputes** → Undersecretary resolves (with data governance team support)
2. **Cross-agency operational disputes** → TMO facilitates resolution between Undersecretaries
3. **Cross-agency sensitive data disputes** → Independent Office Board provides binding decision
4. **Cross-branch disputes** → Independent Office Board (includes judicial, legislative representation)

This structure ensures rapid decision-making for routine data sharing while maintaining appropriate oversight for sensitive categories and cross-agency coordination.

### 3.4 Data Sharing Agreement Templates

**Why Four Template Types Matter:**

Data sharing negotiations currently take 12-18 months because every agreement is custom. Standardized templates reduce this to 4-8 weeks by providing pre-approved legal language, technical specifications, and risk mitigation approaches for common scenarios. For a complete sample Data Sharing Agreement (Type 3: Moderate Sensitivity), see [Template A.2](appendices/06-templates.md#a2-data-sharing-agreement-template-type-3-moderate-sensitivity).

**Template 1: Public Data Exchange**
- **Use Case:** Sharing non-sensitive data between state agencies for operational purposes (e.g., business registry data, public facility locations, aggregate statistics)
- **Key Features:** Simple MOU, minimal restrictions, attribution requirements, update frequency specified
- **Approval Time:** 2-4 weeks (department-level approval sufficient)
- **Example:** DMV shares aggregate vehicle registration data with Air Resources Board for emissions modeling

**Template 2: Confidential Data with Limited PII**
- **Use Case:** Sharing data containing some PII but not highly sensitive (e.g., permit applications, licensing records, low-risk health data)
- **Key Features:** Data Use Agreement (DUA), access controls, audit logging, breach notification procedures, retention limits
- **Approval Time:** 4-6 weeks (requires Chief Deputy Director + data governance team review)
- **Example:** Occupational Safety shares workplace injury reports with Public Health for epidemiological analysis (PII minimized)

**Template 3: Sensitive Data Requiring Enhanced Protection**
- **Use Case:** Highly sensitive PII or protected classes (criminal justice, child welfare, mental health, financial information)
- **Key Features:** Enhanced DUA, role-based access, encryption requirements, independent privacy review, limited retention, strict purpose limitation
- **Approval Time:** 6-8 weeks (requires Undersecretary + Independent Office privacy review)
- **Example:** Corrections shares inmate release data with Social Services for reentry support program eligibility

**Template 4: Cross-Branch or External Entity Sharing**
- **Use Case:** Sharing between executive/legislative/judicial branches or with federal/local governments, academic institutions, or (rarely) private entities
- **Key Features:** Formal inter-branch agreement, explicit statutory authority cited, strict purpose limitation, public transparency requirements, sunset clauses
- **Approval Time:** 8-12 weeks (requires Independent Office board approval)
- **Example:** Executive branch shares arrest data with Judicial Council for pretrial release research; or sharing Medi-Cal data with federal HHS for program oversight

**Benefits of Templates:**
- **Speed:** 90% reduction in negotiation time
- **Legal clarity:** Pre-vetted language reduces risk
- **Consistency:** Similar use cases treated similarly
- **Transparency:** Public can see standard terms
- **Scalability:** New agreements use proven patterns

## 4. Product-Led Delivery Framework

> **Section Summary:** This section describes the technical delivery approach, including service mesh architecture, citizen journey teams, and integration with procurement. For detailed procurement procedures, see [Procurement Guide](05-procurement-guide.md).

### 4.1 Service Mesh Architecture

**Vision:** Replace monolithic point-to-point integrations with service mesh where every system exposes APIs and discovers services through a catalog. This architecture is foundational for AI adoption—AI systems require access to data from multiple sources, and APIs provide the standardized interfaces that make this possible without building custom integrations for each AI application.

**API Standards:**
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0+ specs
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Agency API catalogs for discovery
- Semantic versioning, backward compatibility
- Rate limiting and monitoring
- AI-ready data formats that support machine learning and automated analysis

**Implementation:**
1. Pilot with high-value cross-agency services
2. Mandate for all new procurements
3. Retrofit legacy with API wrappers
4. TMO maintains statewide catalog
5. Prioritize APIs that enable high-value AI use cases (e.g., eligibility determination, fraud detection, service personalization)

### 4.2 Citizen Journey Teams

Citizen Journey Teams bring together E3 Undersecretaries, E3 Chief Deputy Directors, subject matter experts, and Fellows from relevant agencies to redesign citizen experiences around life events (having a baby, starting a business, disaster recovery) rather than agency boundaries. This creates seamless integrated services across traditional organizational silos.

Teams include Executive Sponsors (Undersecretaries), Journey Leads (Senior Fellows or CDDs), agency representatives, ODI design leads, and technical/data governance support. They follow a 12-month operating model: formation, discovery, design, build, and ongoing measurement.

For complete team structure, operating procedures, success metrics, and priority journeys, see [Appendix B.5: Citizen Journey Teams Operating Guide](appendices/07-operational-guides.md#b5-citizen-journey-teams-operating-guide).

### 4.3 Procurement Integration

Product-led delivery requires procurement that moves at the speed of product development. California would integrate contracting directly into the Product Delivery Lifecycle through Enterprise Vendor Pools, modular contracting ($15M cap), and Rapid RFI² challenge-based procurement for innovation.

For comprehensive procurement framework including vendor pool structure, delegated ordering authority, and stage-gate integration, see [Procurement Guide Section 8](05-procurement-guide.md#8-procurement-innovation).
