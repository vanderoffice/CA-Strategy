## The Problem

**California has no technical competence requirements for IT executives.**

CIOs, CISOs, and CTOs are appointed using the same generic management criteria as any other executive—despite overseeing billions in technology spending and protecting data on 40 million Californians.

### The Cost of This Gap

| What's Failing | Taxpayer Cost | How Long |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| EDD fraud continues | **$500M+/year** | Ongoing |
| EDD improper payments | **$1.5B** | 2023-2024 |
| FI$Cal still incomplete | **$1.06B+ spent** | 20 years |
| CDT on high-risk list | Unknown billions | **18 years** |

**October 2025:** California's Cybersecurity Commander was fired after stating his supervisors were "completely out of their depth when it comes to cyber."

## The Solution: Technical Executive Assignment (TEA)

Create a new executive classification requiring **verified technical competence** for IT leadership:

### Who's Covered
- State and Agency CIOs, CISOs, CDOs, CTOs
- IT Director-level positions with delivery responsibility

### How Competence Is Verified (Any One)
1. **Professional certification** (CISSP, PMP, TOGAF, etc.)
2. **10+ years documented technical leadership**
3. **Independent technical panel review**

### What Changes for Appointing Authorities
- Document technical qualification assessment
- Obtain independent review for positions >$200K
- Certify understanding of position's technical scope

## Why This Works

| Concern | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Limits my discretion" | No—ensures you have qualified candidates. Protects you from appointing failures. |
| "Too rigid" | Three pathways. Panel review allows non-traditional backgrounds. |
| "Slows hiring" | Pilot with new hires only. Existing staff grandfathered. |

---

## What We're Asking

**Support the pilot.** CDT will implement TEA for new hires starting Q2 2026.

If it works, we expand to agency CIOs. If it doesn't, we learn and adjust.

**The alternative:** Year 19 of CDT on the high-risk list. Another billion-dollar IT failure. Another cybersecurity incident.

## Timeline

| Phase | When | What |
|-------|------|------|
| **Design** | Now - Month 3 | CalHR drafts standards, legal review |
| **EO Signed** | Month 3 | Governor signs Technical Executive Standards EO |
| **CDT Pilot** | Months 3-9 | New CDT hires go through TEA process |
| **Evaluation** | Month 9 | Assess pilot, refine approach |
| **Expansion** | Year 2 | Extend to agency CIOs, sponsor legislation |

---

## The Bottom Line

**We require doctors to be licensed. Attorneys to pass the bar. Engineers to be certified.**

Why do we let unqualified executives manage billions in IT spending and protect data on every Californian?

**This Executive Order fixes that.**
