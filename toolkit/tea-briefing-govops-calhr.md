## I. The Problem: Billions Lost to Unqualified Technical Leadership

### Documented Failures (Verified December 2025)

| Issue | Cost to Taxpayers | Duration | Source |
|-------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| EDD Fraud | $500M+/year | Ongoing | State Auditor 2025-601 |
| EDD Improper Payments | $1.5B | 2023-2024 | State Auditor 2025-601 |
| FI$Cal Project | $1.06B+ spent | 20 years, incomplete | State Auditor 2024-039 |
| CDT IT Oversight | Unknown billions | 18 years on high-risk list | State Auditor 2025-601 |
| Information Security | Data breach risk | 12 years on high-risk list | State Auditor 2025-601 |

**Total quantified harm: $3B+ in the last two years alone**

### Root Cause: No Technical Competence Requirements

Per CalHR's CEA Manual, minimum qualifications for Career Executive Assignments are **generic management abilities**:

> "(a) Knowledge of the organization and functions of California State Government including the organization and practices of the Legislature and the Executive Branch; principles, practices, and trends of public administration, organization, and management..."

**Critical gap:** CIO, CISO, CDO, and CTO positions have **no domain-specific competence requirements**. The technical exception in Government Code §19889 covers only physicians, attorneys, engineers, and scientists—not IT executives.

### October 2025 Incident

California's Cybersecurity Integration Center Commander, Edward Bómbita, was terminated after raising concerns about unqualified oversight. Per CalMatters (October 10, 2025):

> "Another cybersecurity employee said it is 'completely out of their depth when it comes to cyber. You wouldn't let your plumber perform surgery on you. How does it make any sense for someone who has no basis in the reality of the cyber world to dictate policy?'"

This is not an isolated incident—it reflects a **systemic qualification gap**.

---

## II. Proposed Solution: Technical Executive Assignment (TEA)

### Concept

Create a new subcategory of Career Executive Assignment specifically for technical leadership roles, with **domain-specific qualification requirements**.

### Covered Positions

| Position Type | Scope |
|---------------|-------|
| Chief Information Officer | State CIO and all agency CIOs |
| Chief Information Security Officer | State CISO and all agency CISOs |
| Chief Data Officer | State CDO and all agency CDOs |
| Chief Technology Officer | All CTOs |
| IT Director-level | Positions with direct IT delivery responsibility |

### Qualification Pathways (Any One of Three)

1. **Professional Certification**
   - CISSP, CISM, CISA (security roles)
   - PMP, TOGAF, ITIL Expert (IT management)
   - Relevant domain certifications recognized by CalHR

2. **Demonstrated Experience**
   - 10+ years technical leadership experience
   - Documented outcomes (projects delivered, teams led, budgets managed)
   - References from technical peers

3. **Independent Technical Panel**
   - Three-person panel (one CalHR, one CDT, one external expert)
   - Structured technical interview
   - Written recommendation (public record)

### Appointing Authority Requirements

Secretaries and Undersecretaries making TEA appointments must:
- Document their technical qualifications assessment
- Obtain independent technical review for positions above $200K
- Certify in writing their understanding of the position's technical scope

---

## III. Legal Authority

### Existing Framework Supports This

| Authority | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|
| California Constitution, Art. VII, §4 | Governor may direct executive branch operations |
| Government Code §19889 | Already creates technical exceptions for MDs, attorneys, engineers |
| Government Code §19815.4 | CalHR authority to establish personnel standards |
| CEA Delegation Agreements | Existing mechanism for department-specific requirements |

### Precedent

The current CEA framework **already allows** technical qualifications for positions requiring professional licensure. This proposal simply **extends that logic** to IT roles where technical competence is equally critical.

---

## IV. Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Pilot (Months 1-6)

| Week | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1-4 | Draft qualification standards | CalHR + CDT |
| 4-8 | Legal review of EO language | Governor's Legal |
| 8-10 | Stakeholder consultation | GovOps |
| 10-12 | EO signature | Governor |
| 12-24 | CDT pilot (new hires only) | CDT + CalHR |

### Phase 2: Expansion (Months 6-12)

- Extend to agency CIO positions
- Evaluate pilot outcomes
- Refine qualification pathways based on experience
- Develop public dashboard for TEA compliance

### Phase 3: Codification (Year 2)

- Sponsor legislation to codify TEA in Government Code
- Create permanent Technical Review Board
- Establish ongoing certification/recertification requirements

---

## V. What We Need from GovOps and CalHR

### From GovOps

1. **Political assessment**: Feasibility with Cabinet Secretaries
2. **Coordination role**: Convene stakeholders across agencies
3. **Budget support**: Identify resources for Technical Review Panel
4. **Messaging**: Frame as protecting agencies from blame, not limiting discretion

### From CalHR

1. **Technical expertise**: Draft qualification standards and assessment criteria
2. **Legal review**: Confirm EO approach aligns with existing CEA framework
3. **Process design**: Create TEA appointment workflow
4. **Training**: Prepare appointing authorities for new requirements
5. **Dashboard**: Track TEA compliance across state government

---

## VI. Anticipated Concerns and Responses

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "This limits Secretary discretion" | No—it ensures Secretaries have qualified candidates to choose from. Protects them from appointing failures. |
| "Certification requirements are too rigid" | Three pathways ensure flexibility. Panel review allows for non-traditional backgrounds. |
| "This will slow hiring" | Pilot with new hires only. Existing executives grandfathered. |
| "Unions will oppose" | This targets executives only—not represented employees. Frame explicitly. |
| "We don't have resources for panels" | CDT already has technical staff. External experts can serve pro bono or for nominal stipend. |

---

## VII. Risk of Inaction

**If we do nothing:**

- CDT remains on high-risk list (Year 19, 20, 21...)
- EDD continues $500M+ annual fraud losses
- Next major IT project follows FI$Cal trajectory
- Next cybersecurity incident exposes millions of Californians
- Governor's modernization agenda stalls

**The State Auditor has documented the same problems for 18 years.** The definition of insanity is expecting different results from the same approach.

---

## VIII. Requested Decision

**Today:** Confirm willingness to partner on TEA initiative

**Within 30 days:**
- CalHR designates lead for qualification standards development
- GovOps confirms political feasibility assessment timeline
- Schedule follow-up to review draft EO language
