# Comprehensive Plan: Data Governance Teams for California State Government

## Supporting the Office of Data and Innovation and Innovation Fellows Program

---

## Executive Summary

This plan establishes a framework for creating **fully capable and accountable data governance teams** within California state government to support the **Office of Data and Innovation (ODI)** and the **Governor's Innovation Fellows Program**. The approach leverages existing civil service classification systems that already embed rigorous scientific and engineering standards, problem-solving capabilities at scale, and clear accountability structures.

The key innovation is a **blended expertise model** that integrates domain specialists (scientists, engineers, engineering geologists) alongside dedicated data professionals (Research Data Specialists at the senior/supervisory level) to create teams capable of both understanding what the data means and building modern data infrastructure.

**Why this matters**: California's Data Strategy envisions a robust data ecosystem supporting informed decision-making and innovation while safeguarding privacy and security. ODI's mandate under Government Code Section 12815 requires empowering data use by ensuring the state has the infrastructure, processes, and people to manage data ethically, efficiently, and responsibly. This team model directly addresses these requirements.
