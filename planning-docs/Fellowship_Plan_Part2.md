## Ongoing Modernization Support: Beyond the Fellowship Year

### 1. On-Call Subject Matter Expert Network

**Purpose:** Maintain continuous access to fellowship-trained expertise for ongoing modernization work and departmental challenges.

**Structure:**

**Availability Framework:**
- All fellows remain "on-call" to ODI for ongoing modernization initiatives, strategy work, and emerging challenges
- Time commitment during post-fellowship years: Estimated 5-10 hours/month average (highly variable)
- Prioritized access to fellows for their domain expertise (e.g., fellow embedded in data governance called on for data-related challenges)
- Formal quarterly meeting of SME network to share learnings and coordinate efforts

**Activation Mechanisms:**

- **ODI Initiative Request:** ODI identifies emerging modernization priority; ODI Director solicits participation from relevant alumni fellows
- **Departmental Request:** Department can request specific fellow with relevant expertise (coordinated through ODI); fellow's home agency approves release time
- **Emergency/Crisis Response:** ODI can rapidly activate fellows for urgent departmental challenges or statewide emergencies
- **Knowledge Capture:** Fellows participate in documenting learnings, frameworks, and best practices for broader government use

**Roles as SMEs:**

- **Initiative Participation:** Lead or contribute to ongoing modernization projects building on fellowship insights
- **Advisory:** Provide expertise to departments undertaking initiatives they embedded with or led
- **Implementation Support:** Advise on change management, stakeholder engagement, and execution of modernization initiatives
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Help newer departments understand lessons learned from earlier initiatives
- **Emergency Response:** Deploy to help respond to urgent IT, operational, or modernization emergencies

**Resource Allocation:**
- ODI maintains coordination framework for SME participation
- Home agency recognizes time commitment as part of fellow's performance expectations
- Performance evaluation incorporates ongoing modernization contributions
- Regular reporting on SME network activation and impact

**Sustainability Model:**
- This network creates **permanent, ongoing modernization capacity** beyond the one-year program
- With 6-month rolling cohorts, state adds 21 trained experts every 6 months
- Over 18 months (3 complete cohorts), state has 63 mid-level leaders actively engaged in modernization
- Over 3 years, network grows to 126+ alumni available for expertise and emergency response
- Creates self-sustaining pipeline of expertise and relationships that compounds over time

## Executive Duty Statement Integration

### Positioning Fellowship as Desired Qualification

**Strategic Approach:**

As executive positions open or are reclassified across state government, **inclusion of fellowship participation as a "desirable" or "highly valued" qualification** signals that:
1. State government values modernization-ready leaders
2. Fellowship completion is a recognized marker of executive capability
3. Alumni have competitive advantage in advancement

**Implementation:**

**Phase 1 (Immediate - Months 1-6):**
- Pilot including fellowship participation as desirable qualification in 10-15 senior position duty statements
- Target positions including: CDO/modernization officer roles, deputy secretary roles, policy advisor roles, operations/process improvement manager roles
- Coordinate with CalHR and department heads to identify upcoming openings
- Draft standardized language for duty statements with CalHR

**Phase 2 (Months 6-12):**
- Expand to broader categories of executive positions (20-30 positions)
- Include for positions where enterprise perspective and cross-functional collaboration are critical
- Add fellowship language to position classification standards where appropriate
- Track and celebrate fellows hired into new positions

**Phase 3 (Year 2-3):**
- Further expand to positions across all levels where modernization experience is valuable
- Standardize language across duty statements (40-50+ positions)
- Make fellowship experience a standard desirable qualification for executive-level roles
- Integrate into CalHR competency models and hiring practices

**Sample Duty Statement Language:**

**Under "Desired Qualifications" or "Additional Strengths":**

> Completion of Governor's Innovation Fellowship or equivalent executive leadership development program focused on organizational modernization, cross-functional collaboration, and enterprise perspective. Fellowship graduates bring demonstrated understanding of state government systems, authentic relationships across multiple departments, hands-on experience with change management in complex organizations, and commitment to evidence-based modernization.

**Or as "Special Requirements":**

**Benefit to State:**
- Officers hired with fellowship background bring immediate enterprise perspective and relationships

## Alignment with State Modernization Strategy

The Governor's Innovation Fellowship directly supports statewide modernization priorities:

- **Enterprise Architecture & Integration:** Fellows develop understanding of how departments interconnect; initiatives address integration challenges
- **Customer Experience & Digital Services:** Embedding and initiatives expose fellows to constituent experience and digital service gaps
- **Workforce & Organizational Modernization:** Program itself models continuous learning and cross-functional collaboration as modernization cornerstone
- **Data Governance & Analytics:** Initiatives and embedding experiences identify data sharing and analytics opportunities
- **Leadership Talent Development:** Program intentionally builds next generation of modernization-ready executives with enterprise perspective
- **Culture Change & Adoption:** Fellows become change agents within their departments, modeling and spreading modernization practices

The rolling cohort structure, SME network, and advisory capacity ensures that **modernization learning compounds over time**—each cohort advances the state's modernization capability and institutional knowledge, creating a permanent cultural shift toward enterprise thinking.

---

## Conclusion

The Governor's Innovation Fellowship represents a strategic investment in California government's future. By intentionally developing recurring cohorts of executives who understand enterprise modernization, hold relationships across department boundaries, and remain committed to ongoing stewardship of the state's transformation journey, the state accelerates the pace and sustainability of modernization.

Critically, the program moves beyond individual executive development to create **permanent infrastructure for cross-agency collaboration**—an SME network, advisory capacity, and leadership peer group that sustains and compounds modernization effort across years and multiple cohorts.

The rolling 6-month cohort structure (21 fellows per cohort, 3 complete cohorts by January 2027) ensures continuous momentum and a growing pool of modernization expertise. As alumni advance into leadership positions across state government and become part of a recognized cohort of executives, the program becomes self-sustaining through network effects and career advancement visibility.

The program succeeds when:
- Fellows advance into expanded leadership roles across state government
- Their expertise becomes embedded in state operations and departmental practices
- Next-generation leaders see fellowship completion as a marker of executive capability
- The state's modernization journey becomes self-sustaining through a network of committed leaders
- Emergency response capacity provides tangible value and demonstrates network effectiveness
- Initiative recommendations are implemented and generate measurable business value

**The Governor's Innovation Fellowship is both a talent development program and a structural answer to the challenge of sustaining enterprise modernization across a complex, siloed, government organization.**
