# Governor's Innovation Fellowship Program
## Strategic Plan for State Modernization & Executive Development

**PART 1: PROGRAM OVERVIEW & STRUCTURE**

**Office of Digital Innovation**  
State of California  
November 2025

---

## Executive Summary

The **Governor's Innovation Fellowship** establishes an intentional pipeline of emerging leaders trained to drive enterprise-wide government modernization. Rather than isolating executive development within individual departments, the fellowship creates a **permanent infrastructure for cross-agency collaboration** that sustains ongoing modernization efforts across the state government.

Fellows function as **change architects** and **organizational bridges**—individuals who understand state systems deeply, hold authentic relationships across agency boundaries, navigate complex political dynamics, and serve as both implementers of current modernization initiatives and subject matter experts available on-demand to address emergencies and departmental challenges.

The fellowship explicitly positions its alumni as candidates for expanded leadership roles across state government, signaling that completion of the program is a **desirable qualification in future executive duty statements**. This creates a virtuous cycle: fellows accelerate their careers, state government gains demonstrated leaders, and modernization benefits from continuity of perspective and relationship.
