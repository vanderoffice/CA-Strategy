# Archive: Detailed Operational Content

This folder contains detailed operational content that was extracted from the main strategy appendices to streamline the core document for reviewers and decision-makers.

## Why This Content Was Archived

The main CA-Strategy document is designed for **executives and decision-makers** who need to understand the strategic framework. The archived content is **implementation-level detail** more appropriate for practitioners who will execute the strategy after approval.

**The main appendices now contain:**
- Strategic frameworks and principles
- Key concepts and governance structures
- References pointing to this archive for detailed procedures

**This archive contains:**
- Step-by-step operational procedures
- Detailed checklists and templates
- Week-by-week curricula and schedules
- Technical implementation specifications

## Restoring Content

If stakeholders determine that specific content should return to the main appendices:

2. Paste into the appropriate appendix
3. Update this README to note the change
