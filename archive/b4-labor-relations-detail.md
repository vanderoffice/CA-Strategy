*Archived from appendices/07-operational-guides.md*

## Classification and Compensation Considerations

**New Position Development:**
- Data governance teams require new or modified classifications
- Coordinate with CalHR and relevant bargaining units on position specifications
- Ensure competitive compensation to attract technical talent (see Section 5.4 on science/engineering classifications)

**Career Pathways:**
- Define clear advancement paths from technician to specialist to senior roles
- Recognize certifications and skill development in classification requirements
- Enable mobility between departments for career growth

**Meet and Confer Requirements:**
- Engage unions early on new position classifications
- Provide advance notice of organizational changes
- Document agreements and implementation timelines

## Workforce Transition Framework

**When Automation Reduces Workload:**

| Phase | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Assessment | Identify affected positions | 6+ months before go-live |
| Notification | Inform employees and unions | 4+ months before go-live |
| Options | Present reassignment, retraining, or attrition choices | 3+ months before go-live |
| Transition | Execute reassignments, begin training | At go-live |
| Support | Continued training and adjustment | 6-12 months post go-live |

**Attrition Management:**
- Natural attrition (retirements, voluntary departures) absorbs most position reductions
- Hiring freezes in affected classifications accelerate attrition-based reduction
- No involuntary separations from modernization initiatives

**Enforcement of No-Layoff Commitment:**

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Monitoring** | TMO tracks all separations monthly; flags any coded as "modernization-related" |
| **Reporting** | Quarterly reports to Governor's Office and labor unions on workforce transitions |
| **Escalation** | Departments proposing layoffs must demonstrate: (1) exhausted reassignment options, (2) offered retraining, (3) attrition timeline infeasible. TMO Director and CalHR Deputy Director must concur before any exception. |
| **Consequences** | Departments violating commitment lose access to Breakthrough Fund, face E3 leader performance review |
| **Employee Remedy** | Affected employees may appeal to CalHR; reinstatement + back pay if separation found improper |

**Reassignment Priorities:**
1. Within same department to higher-value work
2. To growing functions (data governance, customer service, compliance)
3. To other departments with needs matching employee skills
4. To new positions created by modernization

## Union Engagement Protocol

**Statewide Level:**
- TMO briefs statewide union leadership quarterly on modernization initiatives
- Formal meet and confer on policies affecting represented employees
- Union representatives invited to Breakthrough Fund review committees

**Department Level:**
- E3 leaders include labor relations in modernization planning
- Advance consultation on workflow changes affecting bargaining unit work
- Regular communication through established labor-management committees

**Project Level:**
- Include union consultation in project stage-gate criteria
- Document workforce impact assessments
- Track and report on job transitions

---

## Training Coordination

**Digital Accelerators Program Integration:**
- Coordinate training schedules with workload and staffing requirements
- Ensure protected learning time (20% of work hours) is operationally feasible
- Partner with unions on training curriculum relevant to represented employees

**Certification Recognition:**
- Work with CalHR to recognize industry certifications in classification specifications
- Enable pay differentials for certified skills where appropriate
- Document certification requirements in duty statements

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Employees displaced (involuntary separation) | 0 |
| Employees successfully reassigned | 100% of affected |
| Training completion rate | 95%+ |
| Union grievances related to modernization | <5 per year statewide |
| Employee satisfaction with transition | >70% positive |

## Escalation Path

Unresolved labor issues escalate through:
1. Department labor relations → Agency labor relations
2. Agency labor relations → CalHR Labor Relations Division
3. CalHR → State Mediation and Conciliation Service (if needed)
4. Critical issues → TMO and Governor's Office awareness
