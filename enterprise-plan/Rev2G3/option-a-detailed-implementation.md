# Option A: Statutory Interagency Governance + Executive Actions

## Deep Dive Implementation Plan

### Overview

Option A strengthens and extends existing ODI and GovOps structures through statute, executive reorganization, and formal agreements. It is the most feasible approach for achieving meaningful statewide data governance within Governor Newsom's remaining term (approximately 13 months to early January 2027).

The option builds on existing institutional relationships, ODI's established credibility, and proven governance models already operating within California (such as the Cradle-to-Career Data System).

## Governance Structure

### California Interagency Data Council (CIDC)

**Composition:**

- **Chair:** Director of the Office of Data and Innovation (or designated representative from GovOps).
- **Executive Branch Members:**
  - Department of Finance.
  - California Department of Technology.
  - Department of General Services.
  - Department of Human Resources.
  - Department of Social Services.
  - Department of Public Health.
  - Department of Justice (if willing to participate).
  - Other major departments as appropriate.
  - Each department designates a Chief Data Officer or Data Steward.

- **Constitutional Officers (by designation):**
  - Attorney General (or designee).
  - State Treasurer (or designee).
  - State Controller (or designee).
  - Secretary of State (or designee).
  - Insurance Commissioner (or designee).
  - Superintendent of Public Instruction (or designee).

- **Judicial Branch:**
  - Representative of the Judicial Council.

- **Legislative Branch:**
  - Legislative Counsel (or designated representative).
  - Potentially, a representative from legislative leadership.

- **Higher Education:**
  - UC Systemwide representative.
  - CSU Systemwide representative.
  - California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office representative.

**Frequency of Meetings:** Quarterly, with working groups meeting as needed.

**Authority:**

- Develop statewide data standards, definitions, and metadata protocols.
- Create policies for interagency data sharing, privacy protection, and security.
- Recommend budget priorities and technology investments related to data infrastructure.
- Oversee sectoral data collaboratives (see below).
- Serve as a clearinghouse for cross-agency data initiatives and identify opportunities for coordination.

**Limitations:**

- The Council is advisory and coordinative for non-executive entities. Non-executive members participate voluntarily and cannot be compelled to adopt Council standards, but standards are published as "statewide norms" and referenced in statute.
- For executive branch members, statutory language makes participation and compliance with Council standards binding.

---

## Statutory Changes Required

### 1. California Data Governance Act (New Legislation)

**Provisions:**

- Establish the California Interagency Data Council in statute.
- Define composition, meeting frequency, and responsibilities.
- Codify that statewide data standards and policies emanate from the Council.
- Require each executive branch department to designate a Chief Data Officer or Data Steward.
- Authorize the Council to create binding policies for the executive branch and to recommend policies for other branches.
- Provide a home for the Council within ODI/GovOps.

**Statutory Language (Illustrative):**

The legislation would create a new section in the Government Code (likely in Title 2, Division 3) establishing:

- Definition of "statewide data standards" and "interagency data sharing."
- Requirement that executive branch entities comply with Council-approved standards.
- Authorization for the Council to adopt policies on data dictionary standards, privacy, security, and interagency data use.
- Statement that non-executive entities are invited to participate and adopt standards on a voluntary basis.
- Annual reporting to the Legislature on Council activities and cross-agency data initiatives.

### 2. Amendments to ODI's Enabling Statute (Government Code §12815)

**Changes:**

- Clarify that ODI is the technical backbone and staff to the Council.
- Expand ODI's mandate to include serving all three branches and constitutional officers as an advisor and convener, not just executive agencies.
- Preserve ODI's innovation and user-centered design role while adding a statewide coordination mandate.

---

## Executive Actions and Reorganization

### 1. Governor's Reorganization Plan (GRP)

**Scope:**

- Consolidate or better coordinate existing data and analytics functions dispersed across executive departments.
- Reduce duplicated data infrastructure investments.
- Establish clearer lines of accountability for data governance within the executive branch.

**Potential Changes:**

- Move or coordinate data analytics units from multiple departments into shared enterprise structures or create clear dependencies/coordination protocols.
- Consolidate redundant data warehouses or analytical platforms.
- Establish data governance decision-making processes that feed into the Council.

**Limitations:**

- GRPs can only affect executive branch agencies. They do not apply to constitutional officers, judiciary, or legislature.
- Constitutional officers may choose to align voluntarily through MOUs (see below).

### 2. Enhanced ODI Capacity and Staffing

**Needs:**

- **Chief Data Officer (expanded role):** Lead Council coordination and statewide data initiatives.
- **Executive Director or Deputy Director, Statewide Data Governance:** Dedicated staff to support Council operations, manage working groups, and coordinate with non-executive entities.
- **Data Standards and Policy Manager:** Develop and maintain statewide data standards, metadata protocols, and data sharing policies.
- **Sectoral Governance Coordinators (2–3):** Manage sector-specific data collaboratives (justice, health, environment/climate).
- **Data Sharing and Privacy Counsel:** Ensure compliance with California privacy laws (CCPA, CPRA) and federal requirements (HIPAA, FERPA, etc.).
- **Technology and Infrastructure Coordinator:** Oversee shared data platforms, APIs, and enterprise tools.

**Budget Impact:**

- Approximately 8–12 new positions ($1.5M–$2.5M annually, including benefits and operations).
- Potential one-time costs for shared infrastructure ($2M–$5M over three years).

---

## Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)

### Partners and Scope

MOUs will be negotiated with:

1. **Constitutional Officers**
   - Attorney General (Department of Justice).
   - State Treasurer.
   - State Controller.
   - Secretary of State.
   - Insurance Commissioner (Department of Insurance).
   - Superintendent of Public Instruction (Department of Education).

2. **Judicial Branch**
   - Judicial Council on behalf of the California court system.

3. **Legislative Branch**
   - Legislative Counsel on behalf of the Legislature.

4. **Higher Education**
   - UC Regents (representing University of California system).
   - CSU Board of Trustees (representing California State University system).
   - California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office.

### MOU Content (Template)

Each MOU would commit the signatory to:

- **Participate in the California Interagency Data Council** and designated working groups.
- **Adopt statewide data standards** where legally and operationally feasible, particularly around:
  - Common data definitions for shared populations (e.g., "individual," "household," "program participant").
  - Metadata standards and data quality expectations.
  - Privacy and security protocols aligned with state and federal law.
- **Support cross-agency data sharing** where:
  - Legal authority exists.
  - Privacy, security, and confidentiality requirements are met.
  - Value is demonstrated to both parties.
- **Participate in sectoral data collaboratives** relevant to the entity's mission (see below).
- **Share data governance challenges and successes** to enable peer learning.
- **Coordinate on data investments** to reduce duplication and leverage shared infrastructure where possible.

### MOU Status

- **Binding:** MOUs are legally binding agreements between the parties.
- **Non-Compulsory Standards:** An entity signing an MOU commits to good-faith participation in Council work and adoption of standards where feasible, but retains autonomy to decline adoption in specific instances if legal or operational reasons apply. Disputes would be resolved through a process defined in the MOU (e.g., escalation to leadership or a neutral third party).

## Sectoral Data Collaboratives

### Model

Modeled on California's Cradle-to-Career Data System, sectoral collaboratives are multi-agency governance structures focused on specific domains. Each collaborative:

- Has a formal charter defining governance, membership, and decision-making.
- Establishes formal data sharing agreements among participating agencies.
- Creates a common technical infrastructure (data warehouse, analytics platform, or shared APIs) where beneficial.
- Operates under legal authority granted by existing statutes or new sector-specific legislation (where needed).

### Proposed Sectors

#### 1. Criminal Justice and Public Safety

**Participating Agencies:**
- Department of Justice.
- Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
- Board of Parole Hearings.
- California Highway Patrol.
- Department of State Hospitals.
- Local law enforcement (via representatives).

**Focus:**
- Unified case tracking and outcome measurement across arrest, prosecution, adjudication, and incarceration.
- Improved recidivism data to support evidence-based sentencing and rehabilitation.
- Public safety analytics to guide resource allocation.

#### 2. Health and Human Services

**Participating Agencies:**
- Department of Social Services.
- Department of Public Health.
- Department of Health Care Services.
- Department of Managed Health Care.

### Governance and Legal Authority

**Governance:**
- Each collaborative has a Steering Committee composed of department heads or designees and representatives from participating agencies.
- An Executive Director or Coordinator (often an existing staff member with the lead data agency) manages day-to-day operations.
- The collaborative reports to the California Interagency Data Council on progress and challenges.

**Legal Authority:**
- Where existing statutes already allow data sharing among member agencies (as in criminal justice or child welfare), the collaborative formalizes and coordinates that sharing.
- Where new authority is needed, sector-specific legislation can be enacted (e.g., a criminal justice data act, health data interoperability act).
- Data sharing agreements and governance charters serve as the operational framework, informed by statute.

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Non-Executive Entities Decline Participation

**Mitigation:**
- Frame participation as voluntary but expected via MOUs and statute.
- Demonstrate value through quick wins before expecting major commitments.
- Allow phased participation (e.g., constitutional officers join first; judiciary joins later).
- Tie certain state funding (e.g., technology procurement, data-related grants) to compliance with data standards.

### Risk 2: Statutory Language Ambiguity

**Mitigation:**
- Engage constitutional law experts in drafting legislation.
- Include explicit limitations and carve-outs for non-executive entities' autonomy.
- Use clear language distinguishing between binding (executive branch) and advisory (other entities) standards.
- Include a dispute resolution mechanism in legislation and MOUs.

### Risk 3: ODI Capacity Constraints

**Mitigation:**
- Begin hiring in June 2026; expect full staffing by late Q4 2026.
- Leverage existing regional or sectoral data coordinators to supplement ODI staff.
- Consider contracting support for specific initiatives (e.g., shared infrastructure development).

### Risk 4: Legislative or Constitutional Challenge

**Mitigation:**
- Coordinate with legislative counsel and constitutional experts early.
- Ensure legislation respects separation of powers.
- Position MOUs as voluntary cooperation agreements, not mandates on independent entities.
- Use conservative statutory language that extends authority only where clearly permissible.

---

## Success Metrics

By end of the Governor's term (early January 2027):

- **Structural:**
  - California Data Governance Act enacted and signed.
  - MOUs signed with at least 80% of targeted partners (6 of 8 constitutional offices, judiciary, legislature, major higher education entities).
  - CIDC meets regularly with stable membership and clear workplans.
  - At least 2 sectoral collaboratives operational (criminal justice, health and human services).

- **Operational:**
  - ODI expanded to 8–12 new staff focused on statewide governance.
  - Shared data standards published and adopted by at least 10 executive agencies.
  - 3–5 high-visibility cross-agency data products or dashboards in use.
  - Shared infrastructure pilot(s) underway with clear roadmap for FY 2027–2028.

- **Impact:**
  - Evidence of improved cross-agency decision-making in at least two high-priority domains (e.g., emergency response, homelessness services).
  - Positive feedback from partners on value of coordination.
  - Media recognition of statewide data governance achievements.

---

## Conclusion

Option A is the most feasible path for achieving meaningful statewide data governance within the remaining 13 months of Governor Newsom's term. By leveraging existing ODI and GovOps structures, enacting targeted legislation, negotiating MOUs, and launching sectoral collaboratives, California can establish the governance framework and demonstrate value that the next administration can sustain and expand.

The key to success is early action, clear stakeholder engagement, and careful execution of the statutory and operational elements outlined above.
