# Statewide Data Governance: Strategic Options for the Governor

## Executive Summary

This memorandum presents two distinct strategic options for establishing meaningful statewide data governance in California. Governor Newsom's term ends in early January 2027, providing approximately 13 months to implement structural changes and demonstrate value.

**Option A: Statutory Interagency Governance + Executive Actions** strengthens and extends existing ODI and GovOps structures through statute, executive reorganization, and formal agreements. It is the most feasible approach for the compressed timeframe.

**Option B: Independent Office of State Data Governance** creates a new, neutral governance entity separate from GovOps with multi-branch board oversight. It is architecturally superior but requires more time and political capital to stand up effectively.

This document presents both options with full detail. Two companion documents provide deep dives on each option, including implementation timelines, governance structures, and resource requirements.

## Context and Problem Statement

The Office of Data and Innovation (ODI), housed in the Government Operations Agency (GovOps), is statutorily limited. Its authority extends only to executive branch entities directly under the Governor's authority. Large portions of state government fall outside this scope:

- **Constitutional Officers and Their Departments:** Attorney General/Department of Justice, Controller, Treasurer, Secretary of State, Insurance Commissioner, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Board of Equalization, Lieutenant Governor.
- **The Judicial Branch:** Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal, Superior Courts, Judicial Council.
- **The Legislature and Supporting Entities:** Legislative Counsel, Legislative Data Center, and various legislative agencies.
- **Higher Education:** University of California (governed by Regents), California State University, community colleges.
- **Independent Entities:** State Compensation Insurance Fund, various independent boards, commissions, and authorities.

Approximately 13 executive branch departments fall under GovOps' direct custody and thus within ODI's current authority. By contrast, California state government encompasses over 200 agencies, departments, boards, and commissions.

The result is a fragmented data landscape. ODI can lead within portions of the executive branch but cannot establish truly statewide standards, governance structures, or unified infrastructure. Major policy decisions across government proceed without coordinated data practices, definitions, or shared infrastructure. Opportunities for cross-agency insights and integrated service delivery are missed.

The Governor seeks a pragmatic path that:
- Produces real, measurable improvements within the remaining approximately 13 months of the current term.
- Respects constitutional boundaries and institutional autonomy.
- Builds structures that the next governor can sustain, expand, or evolve rather than dismantle.

## Option A: Statutory Interagency Governance + Executive Actions

### Structural Overview

Option A builds on and extends existing ODI and GovOps structures through statute, executive reorganization, and formal agreements. The core elements are:

1. **California Interagency Data Council (CIDC)** established in statute with:
   - Chair: GovOps Secretary or ODI Director.
   - Members: Representatives from major executive agencies, constitutional offices, judicial branch, legislature, and higher education.
   - Statutory authority to develop statewide data standards, policies, and minimum requirements for data protection and interagency sharing.

2. **Enhanced ODI statutory mandate** clarifying ODI as the statewide convener and technical backbone for the Council.

3. **Governor's Reorganization Plan** aligning dispersed executive-branch data functions under clearer coordination.

4. **Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)** with constitutional officers, higher education systems, judicial branch, and legislative entities committing to data standards adoption and participation in sectoral collaboratives.

5. **Sectoral governance models** expanding the Cradle-to-Career Data System approach to justice, health and human services, climate and environment, and economic development.

### Benefits

- **Achievable within the timeframe.** Statutory changes, reorganization, and MOUs are tools the Governor and Legislature routinely deploy.
- **Leverages existing structures.** Builds on ODI's established credibility and mandate rather than creating new bureaucracy.
- **Respects constitutional autonomy.** Non-executive entities engage via statute, MOUs, and alignment of interests rather than executive authority.
- **Produces visible outcomes.** Standardized data practices, shared infrastructure, and sectoral collaboratives deliver tangible benefits (improved reporting, integrated service delivery, accurate cross-program analytics) within the term.
- **Favorable political framing.** Enterprise operations strengthening and duplication reduction align with both good-government and efficiency narratives.

### Key Concerns and Risks

- **Limited enforceability for non-executive entities.** Legislative, judicial, and constitutional branches retain full autonomy. Participation relies on persuasion and shared interest.
- **Risks partial implementation.** If major constitutional officers or branches decline to engage, the system remains fragmented.
- **Demands ODI capacity scaling.** ODI must significantly expand capabilities and staffing to support a much broader mandate.
- **Ambiguous authority boundaries.** Without careful statutory language, confusion may arise about where ODI authority ends and persuasive influence begins.

## Option B: Independent Office of State Data Governance

### Structural Overview

Option B creates a new, statutorily independent entity responsible for statewide data governance, separate from GovOps or any single branch. Core elements:

1. **Independent State Office of Data Governance** established by statute, governed by a multi-member Board comprising:
   - Appointees from Governor, Legislature, Judicial Council, constitutional officers, higher education segments.
   - Board appoints Executive Director/State Chief Data Officer subject to Senate confirmation.

2. **Statewide coordination authority** to develop data standards, policies, and frameworks applicable across all branches and sectors where legally permissible.

3. **Neutral convener role** for cross-branch and cross-sector data initiatives.

4. **Separate budget appropriation** ensuring funding independence and cross-branch trust.

5. **Coordination with ODI** rather than replacing it. ODI continues within GovOps focusing on executive-branch implementation and innovation; the independent office provides governance oversight and cross-branch facilitation.

### Benefits

- **Perceived neutrality.** An independent, multi-branch governed entity may be more acceptable to the Legislature, judiciary, and constitutional officers than executive-branch leadership.
- **Longer-term sustainability.** Properly structured, it survives across multiple administrations and continues coordination regardless of gubernatorial priorities.
- **Clear governance focus.** Concentrates exclusively on standards, governance, and oversight while ODI and others handle implementation.
- **Institutional credibility.** Multi-branch governance signals that no single branch or official controls the data agenda.

### Key Concerns and Risks

- **Complex to stand up in 13 months.** Creating an independent entity with multi-branch board consensus, recruiting leadership, and securing broad buy-in is a heavy organizational lift.
- **Potential role confusion with ODI.** Without careful delineation, responsibilities may overlap or conflict, creating inefficiency or turf battles.
- **Political resistance possible.** Some may perceive a new independent entity as unnecessary bureaucracy or as diffusing executive accountability for government data.
- **Sustained multi-branch support required.** Effectiveness depends on continued engagement by all three branches. Disengagement by any party undermines the model.

## Comparative Assessment

### Timeline Feasibility (13 Months Remaining)

| Factor | Option A | Option B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Legislation drafting and passage** | 4–6 months | 6–8 months |
| **Establishing governance structures** | 2–3 months | 4–6 months |
| **Stakeholder alignment** | 2–3 months (executive branch focused) | 3–5 months (requires multi-branch consensus) |
| **Recruiting leadership** | N/A (existing ODI leadership) | 2–3 months (new position, Senate confirmation) |
| **Delivering visible results** | 4–6 months possible | 2–3 months realistic |
| **Overall feasibility** | High | Moderate to challenging |

### Likelihood of Adoption by Non-Executive Entities

**Option A:** Non-executive entities engage with ODI and existing structures on voluntary, project-by-project basis. MOUs create clear expectations but no enforcement. Adoption depends on demonstrated value and voluntary adoption by each partner.

**Option B:** Independent governance structure may be conceptually appealing as neutral, but actual participation depends on confidence in the board's composition and track record. Early participation risk is higher if leadership is untested.

### Sustainability Across Administrations

**Option A:** Embeds data governance into existing state structures and codifies key elements in statute. While a future administration could shift emphasis, the political cost and visibility of rolling back established councils and mandates creates inertia.

**Option B:** If successfully launched, provides a strong platform for long-term coordination. However, survival depends on continued board engagement and appropriations. New administrations may deprioritize funding or reconstitute the board.

## Detailed Implementation Paths

Detailed implementation timelines and governance specifications for each option are provided in companion documents:

- **Detailed Implementation: Option A** – comprehensive timeline, governance structures, legal requirements, and resource estimates.
- **Detailed Implementation: Option B** – board composition, independent office structure, authority delineation, and transition planning.

## Data Governance Context: What Works Elsewhere

Best practices from other states inform both options:

- **Indiana Management Performance Hub:** Began via executive order, then codified in statute to ensure cross-agency data authority and sustained funding. Demonstrates that initial executive action can be followed by legislative institutionalization.
- **Connecticut Chief Data Officer:** Statutorily required agency data officers and an agency CDO Council. Model shows value of distributed data leadership with centralized coordination.
- **Cradle-to-Career Data System (California):** Demonstrates that California can create multi-agency governance boards with formal data sharing authority across independently governed entities (Education, Labor, Social Services, etc.).

Both options align with these models.

## Recommendation: Pursue Option A as Primary Path with Option B as Contingency

**Primary Recommendation: Option A – Statutory Interagency Governance + Executive Actions**

Rationale:

- It is realistically achievable in the 13-month window.
- Leverages ODI and GovOps strengths without requiring new bureaucracy or recruitment.
- Delivers concrete results (standards, shared platforms, sectoral collaboratives) that the next administration inherits and can expand.
- Creates a statutory and operational foundation that could later evolve toward Option B if future governors judge it necessary.

**Contingency/Evolution Path: Option B**

If, during implementation of Option A, the Governor determines that non-executive entity participation would be significantly strengthened by an independent governance structure, legislation could be introduced in early 2026 to stand up the independent office during the final year of the term. Alternatively, the next governor could be positioned to stand it up in their first term, having inherited the statutory framework and governance relationships established through Option A.

## Immediate Next Steps

Assuming a decision on the preferred path in late 2025:

1. **Convene internal working group** (ODI, GovOps, Department of Finance, California Department of Technology, Governor's policy team) to develop legislative and operational specifics.

2. **Initiate stakeholder engagement** with:
   - Legislature (leadership and relevant committee chairs).
   - Constitutional officers (for Option A feedback; for Option B, board composition discussion).
   - Judicial Council.
   - Higher education systems.

3. **Map existing data governance initiatives** (Cradle-to-Career, justice data systems, health data sharing) to understand existing structures and where they can be leveraged.

4. **Develop draft legislation** for the California Data Governance Act or Independent Office, depending on chosen path.

5. **Prepare a transition brief** for the next governor regardless of path chosen, highlighting established structures, in-flight projects, and recommendations for continued momentum.

---

## Conclusion

Both Option A and Option B represent pragmatic, evidence-informed paths to establishing meaningful statewide data governance. Option A is more immediately achievable and leverages existing institutional strengths. Option B, while more structurally ambitious, can be pursued as a longer-term evolution or contingency if Option A's trajectory indicates that independent governance is necessary for broader adoption.

The key decision is not whether to act, but which approach best aligns with the Governor's priority for implementation feasibility, political capital, and legacy building within the remaining term.
