# Implementation Roadmap: The 13-Month Campaign

## Overview

This roadmap integrates the launch of the E3 leadership structure, the Data Governance mandate, and the Product-Led delivery pilots into a single synchronized campaign.

## Phase 1: Mobilization (Nov 2025 – Mar 2026)

_Focus: Legislation, Recruitment, and Planning._

- **Legislation:** Draft and introduce the _California Data Governance Act_ (establishing CIDC) and statutory authorization for E3 positions.
- **Recruitment:** Launch the **Governor's Innovation Fellowship** recruitment drive. Target: 20 Fellows for the first cohort.
- **Governance:** Establish the **Transformation Management Office (TMO)** within GovOps to coordinate the campaign.
- **Procurement:** Issue the first **RFI²** solicitation for the "Life Experience" pilots.

## Phase 2: Deployment (Apr 2026 – Jun 2026)

_Focus: Boots on the Ground._

- **Leadership:** Appoint the first 4 **E3 Undersecretaries** (GovOps, CalHHS, CDCR, CNRA).
- **Data:** Pass the Data Governance Act. Convene the inaugural **CIDC** meeting.
- **Pilots:** Launch the first 3 **Life Experience Teams**:
  1.  **Criminal Justice Data (JDAB)**
  2.  **Health & Human Services (Whole Person Care)**
  3.  **Climate Resilience**
- **Finance:** Seed the **Technology Working Capital Fund** ($50M revolving fund).

## Phase 3: Execution & Scale (Jul 2026 – Sep 2026)

_Focus: Delivering Value._

- **Procurement:** Award the first set of Modular Contracts using the new $10M cap rule.

## Phase 4: Validation & Transition (Oct 2026 – Jan 2027)

_Focus: Locking in the Legacy._

- **Quick Wins:** Public launch of "Beta" services for the pilot Life Experiences.
- **Assessment:** Independent audit of the E3 model's impact (savings, speed, satisfaction).
- **Transition:** Prepare the "Continuity Brief" for the Governor-Elect, recommending the expansion of the E3 model and the potential evolution to an Independent Data Office (Option B).

## Resource Requirements

### The "Grand Unification" Budget

- **E3 Leadership:** $5M/year (Undersecretaries, Deputies, TMO).
- **ODI Expansion (Data Gov):** $4M/year (CIDC support, Standards team).
- **Working Capital Fund:** $50M (One-time seed, replenished by savings).
- **Fellowship Program:** $2M/year (Stipends, recruitment, training).
- **Total FY 2026-27 Ask:** **~$61M** (mostly one-time capital).

## Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                       | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                  |
| :------------------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bureaucratic Rejection** | High   | Use the "Forcing Mechanism" argument; Governor's direct backing is essential.        |
| **Talent Shortage**        | High   | The Fellowship is the critical pipeline; aggressive national recruitment needed.     |
| **Legislative Inertia**    | Medium | Frame Data Governance as a "Good Government" efficiency measure, not a tech project. |
| **Vendor Pushback**        | Medium | Modular contracting threatens incumbents; build coalition of small/medium vendors.   |
