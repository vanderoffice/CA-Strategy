# Future Vision: The California Model

## The Long Game

The **California Enterprise Plan** is designed to deliver immediate results within the current term, but its true value lies in establishing a permanent capability for government evolution.

## Evolution 1: The Independent Data Office (Option B)

We recommend starting with **Option A (Interagency Governance)** because it is faster. However, as the ecosystem matures, the **California Interagency Data Council (CIDC)** should evolve into a fully independent institution: the **Independent Office of State Data Governance**.

- **Why:** To ensure that data governance survives political transitions and remains neutral.
- **When:** 2028-2030 (Next Administration).
- **How:** Legislation to convert the CIDC into an independent board (like the State Auditor), transferring CIDC staff and assets.

## Evolution 2: The "Open Source" State

California has the scale to set the standard for the nation.

- **Shared Services:** We will open-source our Service Mesh components (Identity, Payments) for other states to use.
- **Standardized Data:** Our data dictionary can become the _de facto_ national standard for state government data.
- **Talent Network:** The Governor's Innovation Fellowship will create a nationwide alumni network of technologists who understand government.

## Evolution 3: Automated Government

As the **Service Mesh** matures and data becomes standardized, we can move from "Digital Forms" to "Proactive Services."

- **Auto-Enrollment:** Citizens are automatically enrolled in benefits they qualify for (e.g., CalFresh, Medi-Cal) based on tax data.
- **Predictive Permitting:** Businesses receive permits instantly based on verified data, rather than waiting for manual review.

## Conclusion

We are building the **Operating System for the 21st Century State**. It starts with the E3 leaders, is built with Product-Led methods, and runs on Data.
