# Executive Brief: The California Enterprise Plan

## Executive Summary

Governor Newsom's term concludes in early January 2027. To cement a legacy of effective governance, California must solve a fundamental structural problem: **Government lacks a natural forcing mechanism for efficiency.** Without the profit motive of the private sector, inefficiencies accumulate, systems age, and silos harden.

The **California Enterprise Plan** creates this forcing mechanism through institutional design. It combines three proven strategies into a unified operational model:

1.  **The Engine:** The **E3 Operational Model** (Enterprise Efficiency & Effectiveness) establishes explicit leadership accountability through new Undersecretary and Chief Deputy Director positions.
2.  **The Method:** A **Product-Led Government** approach that replaces monolithic "projects" with continuous "products," delivered by cross-agency **Life Experience Teams**.
3.  **The Catalyst:** A **Statewide Data Governance** mandate (Option A) serves as the immediate "wedge" to launch this structure, delivering tangible results within 13 months.

## The Recommendation: Option A as the Launchpad

We recommend pursuing **Option A: Statutory Interagency Governance** as the primary path. This approach leverages the existing Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) and Government Operations Agency (GovOps) to immediately stand up the **California Interagency Data Council (CIDC)**.

This is not just about data; it is the first battleground for the new E3 leadership. The CIDC will be the venue where E3 Undersecretaries enforce standards, break down silos, and demonstrate the power of the new model.

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. Institutional Accountability (The E3 Model)

We will establish **Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness** in key agencies. These are not advisors; they are operational leaders with authority over technology, procurement, and process optimization. They report to Agency Secretaries but coordinate through a central **Transformation Management Office (TMO)**.

### 2. Product-Led Delivery

We pivot from "Project-Centric" (waterfall, big-bang) to "Product-Led" (agile, continuous).

- **Life Experience Teams:** Cross-agency squads focused on user journeys (e.g., "Disaster Recovery," "Workforce Development") rather than department boundaries.
- **Service Mesh:** A decentralized technical architecture that connects systems via APIs, avoiding the failure points of massive centralized databases.

### 3. Procurement Innovation

We cannot modernize with 18-month procurement cycles.

- **RFI² (Request for Innovative Ideas):** A problem-based procurement method for complex challenges.
- **Modular Contracting:** A strict $10M cap on IT contracts to force modularity and reduce vendor lock-in.

## Immediate Next Steps (First 90 Days)

1.  **Legislation:** Draft the _California Data Governance Act_ to establish the CIDC and E3 authority.
2.  **Recruitment:** Launch the **Governor's Innovation Fellowship** to recruit the first cohort of E3 leaders.
3.  **Pilots:** Charter the first three **Life Experience Teams** (Criminal Justice, Health, Climate) to demonstrate the Product-Led model.
