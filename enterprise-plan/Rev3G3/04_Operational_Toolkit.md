## 1. RFI² (Request for Innovative Ideas) Guide

**Purpose:** To procure solutions for complex problems where the specific technical approach is unknown.

### The Process

1.  **Problem Definition:** clearly state the _outcome_ desired (e.g., "Reduce recidivism by 10%"), not the _technology_ (e.g., "Buy a SQL database").
2.  **Solicitation:** Open call for short (5-page) concept papers.
3.  **Selection:** Select 3-5 vendors for a paid "Prototyping Sprint" ($50k - $100k each).
4.  **Prototyping:** Vendors have 90 days to build a working proof-of-concept using state data.
5.  **Award:** The best prototype wins the full implementation contract.

### Key Rules

- **No lengthy RFPs:** Keep the solicitation under 20 pages.
- **Pay for work:** Always pay vendors for the prototype phase.
- **User Testing:** Evaluation must include testing with actual end-users.

## 2. KPI Dashboard Framework

**Purpose:** To measure the impact of modernization, not just activity.

### The "North Star" Metrics

1.  **User Satisfaction (CSAT):** Measured via post-transaction surveys (Target: >4.5/5).
2.  **Cost per Transaction:** Total system cost / volume (Target: -20% YoY).
3.  **Time to Completion:** Average time for a user to complete the task (Target: -50%).

### Operational Metrics

- **Deployment Frequency:** How often is code released? (Target: Weekly).
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** How fast do we fix bugs? (Target: <4 hours).
- **API Reuse:** Number of other agencies using your API (Target: >2).

## 3. Life Experience Team Charter

**Purpose:** To govern cross-agency squads without creating new bureaucracy.

### Team Structure

- **Product Owner:** A senior E3 leader with decision authority.
- **Tech Lead:** Senior engineer responsible for the Service Mesh architecture.
- **Design Lead:** Responsible for user research and UI/UX.
- **Agency Liaisons:** Subject matter experts from the impacted departments.

### Operating Principles

- **One Team:** Members report to the Product Owner for the duration of the sprint, not their home agency.
- **Open by Default:** All code, documentation, and roadmaps are public (internal or external).
- **Ship Early:** First working prototype must be live within 90 days.
