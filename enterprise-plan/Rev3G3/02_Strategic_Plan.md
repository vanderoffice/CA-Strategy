# Strategic Plan: The Unified Model

## 1. The Core Problem: The Efficiency Paradox

Private sector organizations are driven by the profit motive—a natural forcing mechanism that demands efficiency. Government lacks this. Without an existential threat from inefficiency, technical debt accumulates, and processes ossify.

**The Solution:** We must artificially create this forcing mechanism through **Institutional Design**.

## 2. The E3 Operational Model (The Engine)

The Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) model establishes a new leadership cadre responsible for modernization.

### 2.1 Leadership Structure

- **Statewide:** **Undersecretaries for Efficiency & Effectiveness** embedded in Agency leadership (GovOps, CalHHS, etc.). They report to Agency Secretaries but align strategically with the **Transformation Management Office (TMO)**.
- **Departmental:** **Chief Deputy Directors** in major departments (DMV, EDD, CDCR). They are the operational executors.
- **Talent Pipeline:** The **Governor's Innovation Fellowship** serves as the primary recruitment source, bringing private-sector talent into these roles for 12-24 month tours.

### 2.2 The First Battle: Data Governance

The E3 leaders need a concrete mission to establish their authority. **Statewide Data Governance (Option A)** provides this.

- **The Vehicle:** The **California Interagency Data Council (CIDC)**.
- **The Role:** E3 Undersecretaries serve as the primary voting members of the CIDC, enforcing data standards across their agencies.
- **The Goal:** Break down silos between Health, Justice, and Education to enable "Whole Person Care."

## 3. Product-Led Delivery (The Method)

We are pivoting from "Project Management" to "Product Management."

### 3.1 Life Experience Teams

Citizens don't care about org charts. They care about life events. We will organize cross-agency teams around these journeys:

- **"Having a Baby"**: Integrates Health, Social Services, and Vital Records.
- **"Starting a Business"**: Integrates Secretary of State, Tax Board, and Consumer Affairs.
- **"Disaster Recovery"**: Integrates OES, CAL FIRE, and Insurance.

### 3.2 Service Mesh Architecture

Instead of building massive "Enterprise Service Bus" monoliths (which fail), we will build a **Service Mesh**.

- **API-First:** Every agency exposes its data and services via standardized APIs.
- **Decentralized:** Agencies own their products but adhere to strict interoperability standards enforced by the CIDC.
- **Reuse:** Common components (Identity, Payments, Notifications) are built once and reused everywhere.

## 4. Procurement Innovation

### 4.1 Modular Contracting

- **The Rule:** No IT contract over $10M without a waiver.
- **The Why:** Forces systems to be broken into smaller, lower-risk modules. Increases competition by allowing smaller vendors to bid.

### 4.2 RFI² (Request for Innovative Ideas)

- **The Problem:** Traditional RFPs ask for specific solutions to poorly understood problems.
- **The Solution:** RFI² defines the _problem_ and asks vendors to propose _solutions_. It includes a paid prototyping phase before the final contract is awarded.

## 5. Comparative Assessment

| Feature         | Old Model (Project-Centric) | New Model (Product-Led E3)                      |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Leadership**  | CIOs (often sidelined)      | **E3 Undersecretaries (Operational Authority)** |
| **Focus**       | Internal Agency Silos       | **Life Experience Journeys**                    |
| **Delivery**    | Waterfall "Megaprojects"    | **Agile "Modular Products"**                    |
| **Procurement** | Multi-year, high-risk RFPs  | **RFI² & Modular Contracting**                  |
| **Data**        | Fragmented & Siloed         | **CIDC Governance (Option A)**                  |

**Conclusion:** The Unified Model provides the leadership (E3), the method (Product-Led), and the catalyst (Data Governance) to transform California government within the remaining term.
