# California State Government Modernization Strategy (Rev1G3)

## Executive Brief: The "Product-Led" Government

**Prepared for:** Office of Data and Innovation & Governor's Office of Operations

**Version:** Rev1G3 (Strategic Pivot)

## Executive Summary

The California State Government Modernization Strategy (Rev1G3) represents a fundamental shift from "Project-Centric" IT management to **"Product-Led" Government**. While we retain the essential **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3)** leadership structure to provide the necessary "business-side" command chain, we are radically altering _how_ that leadership delivers value.

We are moving away from monolithic systems, multi-year "waterfall" procurements, and centralized bottlenecks. Instead, we are adopting a **Platform-Enabled** approach: small, autonomous teams delivering modular software, funded by a revolving capital fund, and organized around citizen "Life Events" rather than agency org charts.

## The Core Problem: Misaligned Incentives & Rigid Structures

Government lacks the profit motive that drives private sector efficiency. Without a "forcing mechanism," agencies default to risk aversion, resulting in:

1.  **The "Megaproject" Trap:** Massive, multi-year contracts (> $50M) that are obsolete before they launch.
2.  **The Budget Trap:** "Use It or Lose It" funding that prevents agile iteration and long-term product health.
3.  **The Silo Trap:** Citizens must navigate the org chart (DMV -> Tax Board -> Health Dept) rather than having a unified experience.

## The Solution: E3 Leadership + Product-Led Delivery

We will combine strong institutional accountability with modern, agile delivery mechanisms.

### 1. Institutional Accountability (The "Who")

- **Retained & Reinforced:** We will establish **Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness** at the Agency level and **Chief Deputy Directors** at the Department level.
- **Why:** There is currently no "business owner" for modernization. These roles provide the necessary command chain to guide IT operations, ensuring technology serves policy goals, not the other way around.
- **Governor's Innovation Fellowship:** We will continue to inject high-caliber private sector talent into these roles to drive culture change.

### 2. Product-Led Delivery (The "How")

- **Modular Contracting:** We are instituting a **$10M / 3-Year Cap** on IT contracts. Large systems must be broken into interoperable modules. If a module fails, we fail small and fast.
- **Life Experience Teams:** We will overlay cross-functional teams organized around citizen needs (e.g., "Having a Baby," "Starting a Business") that sit _above_ individual agencies.
- **Persistent Product Teams:** Funding will shift from "Projects" (start/stop) to "Products" (continuous improvement), ensuring systems don't rot after launch.

### 3. Modern Architecture (The "What")

- **Service Mesh & API-First:** We are rejecting the centralized "Enterprise Service Bus" monolith in favor of a decentralized **Service Mesh**. Agencies will expose "Data Products" via standard APIs, allowing for a flexible, resilient ecosystem.
- **Technology Working Capital Fund:** A new revolving fund will allow agencies to borrow for modernization and repay from generated savings, breaking the rigid annual budget cycle.

## Key Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                       | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bureaucratic Inertia**   | HIGH   | **Revolving Fund:** Bypass annual budget fights for valid ROI projects. **Sunset Clauses:** E3 roles expire in 3 years if capabilities aren't embedded.          |
| **Vendor Pushback**        | MEDIUM | **Small Business Fast Track:** Create a streamlined path for small, innovative firms to bid on micro-services (<$250k), reducing reliance on legacy integrators. |
| **Integration Complexity** | HIGH   | **Service Mesh:** Enforce strict API standards. If a system doesn't have an API, it doesn't get funding.                                                         |

## Recommended Next Steps

1.  **Authorize the E3 Leadership Structure:** Appoint the first cohort of Undersecretaries and Chief Deputies.
2.  **Establish the Working Capital Fund:** Seed the revolving fund with initial capital to finance the first wave of modular modernizations.
3.  **Issue the "Modular Mandate":** Executive Order limiting IT contracts to $10M without a legislative waiver.
4.  **Launch 3 "Life Event" Pilots:** Form cross-agency teams for "Disaster Recovery," "New Parent," and "Small Business Start."

_This Rev1G3 strategy moves beyond "managing IT" to "delivering value," ensuring California's government is as modern and dynamic as its economy._
