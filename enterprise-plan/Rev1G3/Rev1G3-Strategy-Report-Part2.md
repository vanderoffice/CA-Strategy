# California State Government Modernization Strategy (Rev1G3)

## Comprehensive Strategy Report - Part 2: Data, Procurement & Workforce

**Version:** Rev1G3 (Product-Led Pivot)
**Date:** November 2025

## Section 4: Data Strategy

### 4.1 From "Master Data Management" to "Federated Data Mesh"

The traditional approach of building a single, centralized "Golden Record" database (MDM) is too slow and brittle for California's scale. We are adopting a **Data Mesh** approach.

**Core Principles:**

- **Domain Ownership:** Agencies (e.g., DMV, Tax Board) remain the owners of their data. They are responsible for its quality and security.
- **Data as a Product:** Agencies must package their critical data as "Data Products"—clean, documented, and accessible via standard APIs—for other agencies to consume.
- **Federated Governance:** The Statewide Data Council sets the _standards_ (interoperability, privacy), but agencies execute the _implementation_.

### 4.2 The "Ask Once" Promise

- **Goal:** Citizens should not have to provide the same information to government twice.
- **Mechanism:** If the DMV knows your address, the Tax Board should be able to consume that "Address Data Product" (with your permission) rather than asking you again.

## Section 5: Procurement Modernization

### 5.1 The Two-Track Procurement Model

We recognize that "one size fits all" procurement fails. We are establishing two distinct tracks:

**Track A: The "Moonshot" (RFI²)**

- **Use Case:** High-uncertainty, complex problems where the solution is unknown (e.g., GenAI for wildfire prediction).
- **Method:** Request for Innovative Ideas (RFI²). Multi-stage, problem-based procurement.
- **Status:** Retained from original strategy.

**Track B: The "Modular Standard" (New Default)**

- **Use Case:** Routine modernization, software development, and system replacement.
- **The Modular Mandate:**
  - **Cap:** No contract > **$10M**.
  - **Duration:** No contract > **3 Years**.
  - **Structure:** Contracts must be for _working software_, not just requirements.
- **Why:** Breaking "Megaprojects" into smaller modules reduces risk. If a $5M module fails, we scrap it and start over. If a $500M system fails, it's a catastrophe.

### 5.2 Small Business Fast Track

- **Problem:** Innovative startups cannot survive 18-month procurement cycles.
- **Solution:** A "Fast Track" authority allowing agencies to purchase micro-services or pilot projects **under $250k** using a simplified process (credit card or 1-page PO), bypassing the complex procurement portal.

## Section 6: Workforce Development

### 6.1 Governor's Innovation Fellowship (Retained)

We continue to recruit high-impact private sector talent for 6-12 month "tours of duty" to seed the E3 leadership roles and Life Experience Teams.

### 6.2 Funding "Teams," Not "Projects"

The biggest barrier to retaining talent is the "Project" funding model, where teams are disbanded once the software launches.

**The "Persistent Product Team" Model:**

- **Shift:** We will fund **Persistent Teams** that own a product (e.g., "Unemployment Claims Portal") for its entire lifecycle.
- **Benefit:** This allows teams to retain institutional knowledge, iterate based on user feedback, and manage technical debt continuously.
- **Funding Source:** These teams are funded via the Technology Working Capital Fund (see Part 3) as operational expenses, not capital projects.

### 6.3 The "Digital Corps"

- **Entry-Level Pipeline:** A dedicated hiring pathway for recent graduates in CS, Design, and Data Science, modeled after the federal U.S. Digital Corps.
- **Rotation:** Corps members rotate through different agencies for 2 years before placement.
