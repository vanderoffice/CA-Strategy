# Rev1G3: Product-Led Government (Strategic Pivot)

This folder represents a significant evolution of the modernization strategy, moving from a "Project-Centric" approach to a **"Product-Led" Government**. The core insight driving this pivot is that successful modern organizations do not manage IT as a series of start-stop projects, but as continuous, evolving products.

## Core Concept: Product-Led Delivery

The **Rev1G3** strategy retains the leadership structure (E3) from the original plan but fundamentally changes the delivery mechanism:

- **Life Experience Teams:** Cross-agency teams organized around citizen needs (e.g., "Having a Baby," "Starting a Business") rather than agency silos.
- **Modular Contracting:** A strict $10M cap on IT contracts to force the breakdown of monolithic systems into smaller, manageable modules.
- **Service Mesh Architecture:** Replacing centralized "Enterprise Service Bus" monoliths with decentralized, API-first data products.
- **Technology Working Capital Fund:** A revolving fund to allow agencies to invest in modernization outside of the rigid annual budget cycle.

## Why the Pivot?

The original "Project-Centric" approach risked perpetuating the "Megaproject Trap"—large, multi-year contracts that are obsolete by the time they launch. This revision aligns California's strategy with modern software development best practices (Agile, DevOps, Product Management) to ensure faster delivery and continuous improvement.
