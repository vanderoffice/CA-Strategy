# California State Government Modernization Strategy

This repository contains the evolving strategic plans and frameworks for modernizing the California State Government. The documents trace the evolution of the strategy from an initial focus on operational efficiency to a "Product-Led" delivery model, and finally to a comprehensive Statewide Data Governance framework.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, each representing a distinct phase or focus area of the strategy:

### 1. `original/` - The E3 Operational Model

**Focus:** Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3)
This folder contains the initial strategy focused on establishing a "forcing mechanism" for government efficiency. It proposes a leadership structure (Undersecretaries and Chief Deputy Directors) to drive modernization through a traditional, albeit optimized, project-centric approach.

- **Key Concept:** "Government without a profit motive needs a structural forcing mechanism."

### 2. `Rev1G3/` - Product-Led Government (Strategic Pivot)

**Focus:** Product-Led Delivery & Life Experience Teams
This revision represents a fundamental shift from "managing IT projects" to "delivering products." It introduces the concept of cross-agency "Life Experience Teams" (e.g., "Having a Baby") and advocates for modular contracting, a service mesh architecture, and a revolving technology fund.

- **Key Concept:** "Move from monolithic systems to modular, autonomous teams delivering value continuously."

### 3. `Rev2G3/` - Statewide Data Governance

**Focus:** Data Governance & Interagency Collaboration
This folder addresses the critical challenge of fragmented data across the state. It presents two strategic options for the Governor:

- **Option A:** Strengthening existing interagency governance (Statutory Council + Executive Actions).
- **Option B:** Establishing a new, independent Office of State Data Governance.
- **Key Concept:** "Unlocking the value of state data requires a unified governance framework that respects institutional autonomy."
