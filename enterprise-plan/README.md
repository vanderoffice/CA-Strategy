## Folder Structure

### `original/` - E3 Operational Model

**Focus:** Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3)

The initial strategy focused on establishing a structural "forcing mechanism" for government efficiency. Proposes leadership structures (Undersecretaries and Chief Deputy Directors) to drive modernization through an optimized project-centric approach.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Executive-Brief.md | High-level summary for leadership |
| Strategy-Report-Part1.md | Strategic context and vision |
| Strategy-Report-Part2.md | Implementation framework |
| Strategy-Report-Part3.md | Governance and accountability |
| Presentation-Slides.md | Stakeholder presentation materials |
| Templates-Frameworks.md | Practical implementation tools |

**Key Concept:** *"Government without a profit motive needs a structural forcing mechanism."*

---

### `Rev1G3/` - Product-Led Government

**Focus:** Product-Led Delivery & Life Experience Teams

A fundamental shift from "managing IT projects" to "delivering products." Introduces cross-agency Life Experience Teams (e.g., "Having a Baby," "Starting a Business") and advocates for:

- Modular contracting
- Service mesh architecture
- Revolving technology fund
- Continuous value delivery

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Rev1G3-Executive-Brief.md | Strategic pivot summary |
| Rev1G3-Strategy-Report-Part1-3.md | Detailed implementation |
| Rev1G3-Presentation-Slides.md | Communication framework |
| templates/ | Governance Charter, KPI Dashboard, RFI Guide |

**Key Concept:** *"Move from monolithic systems to modular, autonomous teams delivering value continuously."*

---

### `Rev2G3/` - Statewide Data Governance

**Focus:** Data Governance & Interagency Collaboration

Addresses the critical challenge of fragmented data across the state. Presents two strategic options for the Governor:

| Option | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Option A** | Strengthen existing interagency governance (Statutory Council + Executive Actions) |
| **Option B** | Establish new, independent Office of State Data Governance |

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| data-governance-main-brief.md | Strategic context and options |
| option-a-detailed-implementation.md | Council-based approach |
| option-b-detailed-implementation.md | Independent office approach |

**Key Concept:** *"Unlocking the value of state data requires a unified governance framework that respects institutional autonomy."*

---

### `Rev3G3/` - Integrated Strategy

**Focus:** Comprehensive Modernization Roadmap

The latest iteration integrating lessons from previous phases into a cohesive, actionable strategy.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| 01_Executive_Brief.md | Leadership summary |
| 02_Strategic_Plan.md | Comprehensive strategy |
| 03_Implementation_Roadmap.md | Phased execution plan |
| 04_Operational_Toolkit.md | Practical tools and templates |
| 05_Future_Vision.md | Long-term direction |
