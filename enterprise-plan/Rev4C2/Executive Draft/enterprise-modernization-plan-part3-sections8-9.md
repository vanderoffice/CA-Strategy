# California Enterprise Modernization Plan
## Part 3: Breakthrough Fund and Implementation (Sections 8-9)

**Date:** December 2025  
**Version:** Executive draft v1.0

---

## 8. Breakthrough Modernization Fund

### 8.1 Fund Structure and Capitalization

**Initial Seed Investment: $100 Million Total**

- **State of California contribution: $50 million**
- **Private sector partner contribution: $50 million**
- **50/50 partnership** creating "Innovation Sidecar Fund"

**Permanent Positions Funded Separately:**

All permanent state positions (E3 Undersecretaries, Chief Deputy Directors, data governance teams, TMO staff) are funded through **ongoing General Fund appropriations**, NOT from the $100M Breakthrough Fund. This ensures:
- Breakthrough Fund focuses on catalytic project investments, not operating costs
- Sustainable long-term funding for institutional infrastructure
- Clear separation between transformation projects and permanent staffing

### 8.2 Transparency and Public Benefit Framework

**Why Transparency Matters:**

Public-private partnerships require explicit accountability to both taxpayers and investors. Californians must understand how their tax dollars deliver better services. Private partners must understand return on investment. Transparency prevents skepticism and builds trust.

**Public Reporting and Accountability:**

**Quarterly Public Dashboards:**
- All funded projects listed with: title, department, problem statement, funding amount, timeline, current status
- Performance metrics: cost savings realized, services improved, digital adoption rates, citizen satisfaction scores
- Risk flags: projects behind schedule, over budget, or underperforming
- Publicly accessible via dedicated website; no login required

**Annual Portfolio Report:**
- Comprehensive analysis of portfolio performance
- Total capital deployed, realized savings, return on investment
- Key wins and reusable innovations highlighted
- Failures and lessons learned documented (no-blame learning culture)
- Submitted to Legislature, Governor, and public simultaneously

**Legislative Oversight:**
- Annual briefing to relevant legislative committees
- Response to legislative inquiries within 30 days
- Budget change proposals justified with portfolio data

**How the People of California Benefit:**

- **Better Services:** Faster, more accessible, user-friendly government services (online business licensing in days not months, integrated social services reducing repeat paperwork, multilingual accessible interfaces)
- **Reduced Failures:** Fewer failed IT projects wasting tax dollars; modular approach contains failures before they become catastrophic
- **Improved Access:** Digital-first services available 24/7 from any device; rural and underserved communities gain equal access
- **Cost Savings:** Efficiency gains return dollars to General Fund for other priorities or tax relief
- **Transparency:** Public can track every dollar and see results; government accountability increases

**How the Public Sector Benefits:**

- **Modernized Systems:** Legacy systems replaced with maintainable, secure, cloud-based platforms
- **Reduced Technical Debt:** 70-80% IT budget currently consumed by legacy maintenance; modernization releases funds for innovation
- **Better Data Use:** Integrated data enables evidence-based policy, fraud detection, outcome measurement
- **Workforce Empowerment:** Staff equipped with modern tools; job satisfaction improves; talent retention increases
- **Risk Reduction:** Modular approaches, small contracts, and incremental delivery reduce "big bang" project failures

**How the Private Sector Benefits:**

- **Common Technical and Architectural Patterns:** Breakthrough-funded projects establish standardized APIs, data schemas, integration patterns, and design systems that private sector vendors can leverage
- **Easier Integration:** Vendors building solutions for California government benefit from well-documented, consistent technical standards rather than navigating 170 different agency-specific approaches
- **Meeting Unique Governmental Needs:** Private sector gains deep understanding of government constraints (procurement, privacy, accessibility, equity) enabling them to build solutions applicable to other states and jurisdictions
- **Co-Learning Opportunities:** Breakthrough partners participate in retrospectives, design reviews, and innovation showcases; insights transferable to commercial products
- **Replication Potential:** Successful California innovations become templates for other states; vendors can offer proven solutions nationally
- **Market Development:** Demonstrating government modernization viability creates market demand in other jurisdictions

**No Governance Control:**

Breakthrough partners do NOT gain:
- Voting rights on project selection or state policy decisions
- Access to non-public citizen data
- Preferential vendor status in procurements
- Influence over Independent Data Governance Office standards

Partnership is financial and technical co-learning, not governance participation.

### 8.3 Feedback Loop and Sustainability Model

**How Projects Generate Ongoing Modernization Capacity:**

**Step 1: Project Delivers Measurable Savings**
- Example: Business licensing automation reduces processing time from 45 days to 3 days
- Staffing reduced from 20 FTE to 8 FTE through automation
- Annual cost reduction: $1.2M (12 FTE × $100K loaded cost)

**Step 2: Department Budget Adjusted**
- Department baseline budget reduced by realized savings ($1.2M annual reduction)
- Budget reduction implemented in subsequent fiscal year after savings validated

**Step 3: Fixed 25% Diverted to Breakthrough Fund**
- 25% of $1.2M = $300K diverted to Breakthrough Fund annually
- 75% ($900K) returns to General Fund for other priorities

**Step 4: Reinvestment Creates Next Generation Projects**
- Accumulated savings fund new modernization projects
- Fund becomes self-sustaining over 5-7 years as project portfolio matures
- Private sector partners can exit once fund reaches self-sustainability, or continue partnership

**Portfolio Management Approach:**

ODI manages Breakthrough Fund using venture capital portfolio principles:

**Risk Diversification:**
- **70% of funding:** Proven approaches with high success probability (replicating successful pilots, scaling working innovations)
- **20% of funding:** Medium-risk innovations with demonstrated feasibility (new technologies, novel process redesigns)
- **10% of funding:** High-risk, high-reward moonshots (emerging AI applications, radical business model changes)

**Stage-Gate Investment:**
- Initial funding: Small pilot/proof-of-concept ($250K-$500K)
- Phase 2: Scaled pilot in 2-3 departments ($1M-$3M)
- Phase 3: Statewide deployment ($5M-$10M)
- Projects advance only after achieving phase milestones; failures stopped early

**Metrics-Driven Decisions:**
- Every project has defined success metrics and decision criteria
- Quarterly reviews assess progress; underperforming projects redirected or terminated
- No "sunk cost fallacy"; willingness to stop projects prevents wasteful continuation

### 8.4 Eligible Project Types

**Breakthrough Fund Prioritizes:**

1. **Cross-Agency Innovations:** Projects requiring coordination across multiple agencies where no single agency can fund alone (integrated eligibility systems, shared identity management, multi-agency disaster dashboards)

2. **Replicable Platforms:** Investments creating tools multiple agencies can use (California Design System, API gateway, data sharing infrastructure, workflow automation templates)

3. **Scaling Proven ODI DIF Projects:** Accelerating successful Data and Innovation Fund pilots to statewide deployment

4. **Emerging Technology Pilots:** Carefully governed experiments with AI, automation, blockchain, IoT where appropriate to government context

5. **Capability Building:** Investments in training infrastructure, Communities of Practice, knowledge management systems that build statewide capacity

**Not Eligible:**
- Single-agency projects that should be funded through department budgets
- Routine IT infrastructure (desktop replacement, network upgrades, standard software licensing)
- Projects lacking clear success metrics or outcome measurement plans
- Vendor-specific solutions creating lock-in
- Projects incompatible with state technology standards or data governance policies

- California positioned as definitive national model for 21st-century government effectiveness

### 9.4 Critical Success Factors

**Executive Commitment (5+ years):**
Sustained engagement from Governor and Agency Secretaries essential. Government transformation requires 7-10 years; early leadership departure derails momentum. Communicate realistic timelines; celebrate incremental wins; maintain focus through political cycles.

**Actual Authority (Not Advisory Roles):**
E3 leaders must have real decision-making power over technology investments, data sharing mandates, procurement approvals, performance accountability. Independent Office provides cross-branch legitimacy and enforceable authority. Without authority, modernization remains optional.

**GovOps Coordination Infrastructure:**
TMO within GovOps must have adequate staffing, authority, and resources to coordinate statewide efforts effectively without micromanaging agency E3 leaders. Balance support with autonomy.

**Readiness-Based Deployment:**
Rigorously use Readiness Assessment framework to sequence investments. Early successes in Tier 1 departments build momentum and credibility. Premature deployment to Tier 3-4 departments creates failures that generate resistance. Invest in capability-building before E3 deployment for low-readiness departments.

**Quick Wins (Year 1):**
Deliver 5-10 visible improvements within first year to build credibility, demonstrate capability, overcome skepticism. Quick wins create coalition for change; absence of wins fuels opposition.

**Measurement Discipline:**
Transparent reporting of progress AND setbacks. Publish metrics even when unfavorable. What gets measured gets managed. Create learning culture where failures are analyzed, not hidden.

**Talent Development at Scale:**
Fellowship provides surge capacity (60 new leaders annually) but sustainable transformation requires workforce investment through data governance teams, CalAcademy training, and career pathway development.

**ODI Integration:**
Leverage ODI's proven approaches, tools, and expertise. E3 leaders actively partner with ODI, mandate adoption of ODI-developed standards, allocate budget for ODI services. ODI transitions from optional consultant to essential enabler.
