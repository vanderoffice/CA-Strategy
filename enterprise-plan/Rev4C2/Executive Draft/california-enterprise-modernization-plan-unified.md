# California Enterprise Modernization Plan
## Comprehensive Strategic Plan

**Prepared for:** Governor's Office, Office of Data and Innovation, Government Operations Agency
**Date:** December 2025
**Version:** Executive draft v1.0

---

## Executive Summary

California state government lacks the natural forcing mechanism that drives private sector efficiency. Without market pressure, government agencies accumulate technical debt, maintain outdated systems, and perpetuate inefficient processes. Legacy systems consume 70-80% of IT budgets; procurement cycles average 18-24 months; only 35-40% of transactions are completable online.

**The Solution: The E3 Operational Model**

The **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model** creates institutional accountability for modernization through three integrated components:

1. **Institutional Accountability** — New leadership positions with actual authority:
   - *Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness* at Agency level (8-12 positions)
   - *Chief Deputy Directors for Efficiency and Effectiveness* at Department level (30-40 positions)
   - *Transformation Management Office (TMO)* within GovOps for statewide coordination

2. **Product-Led Delivery** — Modern approaches replacing waterfall:
   - Service mesh architecture connecting systems via APIs
   - $10M modular contracting cap reducing vendor lock-in
   - RFI² procurement defining problems rather than prescribing solutions

3. **Data Governance Foundation** — Cross-branch authority:
   - Independent Office of State Data Governance with 9-member board
   - Standardized data sharing agreement templates (reducing 18 months to 4-8 weeks)
   - Binding statewide data standards

**Talent Pipeline:** The Governor's Innovation Fellowship produces 60 trained modernization leaders annually through 6-month cohorts. Permanent Data Governance Teams (300-500 positions statewide) provide sustainable capacity.

**Funding:** The California Breakthrough Modernization Fund ($100M: 50% state, 50% private sector) uses portfolio management principles. A feedback loop diverts 25% of realized savings back to the fund, creating self-sustaining modernization capacity.

**Implementation Timeline:**
- **6 Months:** 4 Undersecretaries appointed, TMO established, Fellowship Cohort 1 launched, 3-5 quick wins
- **12 Months:** 10 Chief Deputy Directors deployed, Independent Office operational, $100M fund capitalized
- **36 Months:** Full E3 deployment (8-12 Undersecretaries, 30-40 Chief Deputy Directors), 120+ Fellows graduated, 50% digital adoption, 25% legacy reduction

**Critical Success Factors:** Executive commitment (5+ years), actual authority (not advisory roles), readiness-based deployment using the Readiness Assessment framework, quick wins in Year 1, and measurement discipline.

## 1. Strategic Foundation

### 1.1 Vision Statement

California state government operates with the efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation of leading organizations while maintaining public sector values of equity, transparency, and accessibility. Every Californian experiences government services that are digital-first, user-centered, and seamlessly integrated across agencies—delivered through empowered teams using modern tools, shared data, and continuous improvement practices that make government as responsive as the best private sector organizations.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

Transform California's government operations through the Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model, creating institutional forcing mechanisms that drive continuous improvement, technological modernization, and excellence in public service delivery. By establishing empowered leadership positions, independent data governance, continuous talent development, and sustainable funding mechanisms, California will demonstrate that government can deliver exceptional outcomes while remaining accountable, transparent, and equitable.

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

**Citizen-Centric Design**  
Every technology investment and process change must demonstrably improve citizen experiences. User research, accessibility testing, and satisfaction measurement inform all decisions. Services should be organized around life experiences—not organizational charts. Government exists to serve people, and every system, process, and policy should reflect that fundamental purpose.

**Evidence-Based Decision Making**  
Data, metrics, and rigorous evaluation guide resource allocation, project prioritization, and performance assessment. The Readiness Assessment framework ensures strategic deployment of resources based on department preparedness, reducing risk and maximizing probability of success. Transparency in both successes and failures enables organizational learning. What gets measured gets managed; what gets shared gets improved.

**Actual Authority**  
E3 leaders and governance bodies must have real decision-making power over technology investments, data sharing mandates, procurement approvals, and performance accountability—not merely advisory roles. The Independent Office structure and E3 leadership positions provide enforceable authority that transcends traditional agency boundaries. Without authority, modernization becomes optional; with authority, it becomes inevitable.

**Readiness-Based Deployment**  
Not all departments are equally prepared for modernization. Strategic use of the Readiness Assessment framework ensures resources flow to departments positioned for success, creating early wins that build momentum rather than premature failures that generate resistance. This principle recognizes that transformation requires capability, not just commitment.

**Open and Collaborative**  
California's modernization serves as an open-source model for peer states. Collaboration with private sector partners, academic institutions, ODI expertise, and other governments accelerates progress. Breakthrough Fund partners co-invest and co-learn, creating replicable patterns applicable beyond California. Open innovation multiplies impact.

**Equity and Inclusion**  
Digital transformation must not create new barriers for underserved populations. Multi-language support, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum), digital literacy programs, and alternative service channels ensure universal access. Services must be designed with—not just for—the communities they serve. Technology should reduce disparities, not amplify them.

**Sustainable and Scalable**  
Solutions must work at California's scale (40 million residents, 170 departments, 230,000+ employees) and remain maintainable over decades. Avoid bespoke systems and proprietary vendor lock-in. Prefer cheap, scalable, self-supportable innovative solutions over giant monolithic systems that create long-term dependencies and technical debt. Sustainability means both financial and operational longevity.

**Security and Privacy by Design**  
Cybersecurity, data privacy (CCPA compliance), and ethical AI use are embedded from project inception, not added retrospectively. Every data sharing agreement, every API, every system must meet stringent security standards appropriate to data sensitivity. Trust is California's most valuable asset—and most fragile.

### 1.4 The Core Problem

Private sector organizations face market-driven pressure to optimize operations. Poor efficiency leads to higher costs, reduced competitiveness, declining revenue, and potential business failure. This forcing mechanism drives continuous improvement, innovation, and accountability. Companies that fail to adapt cease to exist.

Government agencies operate without this existential pressure. Budget allocations continue regardless of operational efficiency. Services remain monopolistic—citizens cannot choose alternative providers. Technology systems persist decades beyond useful life because replacement lacks urgency. Poor performance rarely triggers consequences; risk-averse cultures prioritize stability over improvement. The incentive structure rewards maintaining the status quo.

**Measurable Consequences (2024-2025 Data):**

- **Legacy System Crisis:** Legacy systems consume 70-80% of IT budgets, leaving 20-30% for innovation, modernization, and new capabilities. The average age of critical government systems exceeds 25 years, with some mainframe systems dating to the 1970s and early 1980s. These systems require increasingly scarce technical expertise (COBOL, Fortran, AS/400) and face mounting failure risks.

- **Data Fragmentation:** Over 400 independent systems across state government prevent information sharing, forcing citizens to provide the same information multiple times to different agencies. Data sharing agreements take 18 months on average to negotiate and execute, creating barriers to cross-agency collaboration and integrated service delivery.

- **Procurement Delays:** Traditional procurement cycles average 18-24 months from requirement definition to contract award, delaying technology adoption by years and compounding costs. Large monolithic contracts create vendor lock-in, reduce competition, and concentrate risk in single points of failure.

- **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities:** Outdated infrastructure exposes citizen data to increasing threats. Systems lacking modern security controls (multi-factor authentication, encryption at rest and in transit, continuous monitoring, zero-trust architecture) create organizational risk and compliance challenges.

- **Workforce Skills Gap:** 33% of government workers have low or no digital skills despite 92% of jobs now requiring them. Compensation gaps of 20-40% versus private sector drive technical talent attrition, particularly in high-demand specialties (cloud architecture, data science, cybersecurity, DevOps). The average age of IT workers in government exceeds 50, with retirement wave creating knowledge loss.

- **Service Delivery Gaps:** Only 35-40% of government transactions are completable entirely online as of 2024. Citizens must navigate fragmented services, visit multiple agencies for related needs, and interact with systems designed around bureaucratic structures rather than user needs. Multi-language support and accessibility compliance remain inconsistent.

- **Innovation Deficit:** Risk-averse cultures penalize failure more than they reward innovation. Experimentation requires extensive approvals; pilots struggle to reach production; "not invented here" syndrome limits knowledge sharing across agencies. First-mover disadvantage discourages initiative.

California cannot rely on organic improvement. These structural problems require structural solutions. The state must deliberately create the forcing mechanism that drives efficiency and effectiveness through institutional design.

### 1.5 The Office of Data and Innovation: Pioneer and Partner

The **Office of Data and Innovation (ODI)** has pioneered the approaches this plan scales statewide. Understanding ODI's history, mission, and proven capabilities is essential to understanding how E3 succeeds.

**ODI History and Evolution:**

- **July 1, 2016:** Governor Jerry Brown hired Zachary Townsend as California's inaugural Chief Data Officer within GovOps, signaling commitment to data-driven government
- **July 1, 2019:** Office of Digital Innovation formally established within GovOps under Government Code Section 11546, with statutory mandate to drive innovation across state government
- **2022:** Governor Newsom merged Office of Innovation with CalData, creating Office of Data and Innovation to unify data and innovation capabilities
- **July 1, 2023:** ODI became an independent standalone department (no longer within GovOps hierarchy), signaling expanded mandate and strategic importance

**ODI Mission and Strategic Goals:**

**Mission:** "We drive innovation across California state government, using data, technology, and human-centered design to achieve exceptional, equitable outcomes for all Californians. We collaborate with leaders and communities throughout California and the world. We partner to build empathy for the people we serve and create a government that is easy to interact with and solves big problems."

**Strategic Goals:**
- Develop a statewide culture of innovation that drives efficiency and improves customer experience
- Establish statewide standards to transform service delivery, increase government efficiency, and improve outcomes
- Enable departments to adopt tools and practices that support continuous improvement and performance measurement
- Embed equity in service design and delivery
- Position California as national leader in government innovation

**ODI Programs and Capabilities:**

- **Data and Innovation Fund (DIF):** Legislatively funded partnership program enabling ODI to co-create innovative solutions with state departments; 30+ projects completed since 2022, addressing challenges from social safety net enrollment to fraud detection to service accessibility

- **CalAcademy:** Comprehensive training platform providing courses in human-centered design, plain language, user research, data best practices, innovation methods, and digital service delivery; thousands of state employees trained annually

- **CalInnovate:** Service design, user research, and human-centered design consulting for state departments; partners with agencies to reimagine citizen experiences and identify improvement opportunities

- **CalData:** Open data portal (data.ca.gov) aggregating datasets from multiple agencies; provides transparency, enables research, and supports data-driven decision making

- **Statewide Chief Data Officer:** Housed within ODI, providing data governance leadership, standards development, and coordination across executive branch

- **Generative AI Leadership:** Executive Order N-12-23 tasked ODI with studying AI development, risks, and responsible deployment framework for state government; ODI leads AI governance and ethical use policy development

**ODI's Proven Impact:**

ODI has demonstrated measurable results through collaborative projects:
- Improved social safety net program uptake through better service design and simplified enrollment processes
- Reduced data errors and fraud through analytics, validation, and cross-system verification
- Increased access for historically underrepresented communities through equity-focused design and multi-language support
- Created reusable tools and platforms (California Design System, API standards, data sharing templates) enabling faster department innovation
- Established thought leadership nationally through presentations, publications, and peer state collaboration

**ODI's Role in This Plan:**

The E3 model creates empowered champions at every agency who can mandate adoption of ODI-developed tools, practices, and standards. ODI transitions from optional service provider to essential enabler:

- **Innovation Methods:** CalInnovate approaches become standard practice for all E3 initiatives
- **Training Infrastructure:** CalAcademy becomes foundational training for all E3 leaders, Fellows, and data governance teams
- **Technical Standards:** ODI-developed API standards, data sharing templates, and design systems become mandatory rather than voluntary
- **Partnership Model:** E3 leaders allocate budget for ODI services and mandate department participation in ODI programs
- **Performance Analytics:** ODI expertise supports TMO performance measurement and dashboard development

By embedding ODI methods in E3 structure, proven approaches scale from pilot projects to enterprise-wide practice.

### 1.6 Government Operations Agency: Coordination Hub

The **Government Operations Agency (GovOps)** serves as California's management and efficiency agency, providing the infrastructure and coordination capability essential to E3 success.

**GovOps History and Mission:**

- **Established:** July 1, 2013 through Government Reorganization Plan No. 2
- **Purpose:** Improve management and accountability of state government programs, increase efficiency, promote coordinated operational decisions, and streamline services to Californians
- **Structure:** Cabinet-level agency reporting to Governor

**GovOps Constituent Departments:**
GovOps directly oversees 13 departments, boards, and offices:
- California Department of Technology (CDT) - IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, enterprise architecture
- California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) - workforce management, classification, labor relations
- Department of General Services (DGS) - procurement, real estate, facilities management
- Franchise Tax Board (FTB) - tax administration and collection
- Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) - innovation, data governance, service design
- State Personnel Board (SPB) - merit system oversight
- Office of Administrative Law (OAL) - regulatory review
- And others supporting core government operations

**Current Jurisdictional Scope:**

GovOps' direct authority is primarily limited to these 13 constituent entities. While GovOps can convene, advise, and coordinate across broader state government, it cannot mandate adoption of standards, practices, or technologies in other cabinet agencies (CalHHS, CNRA, Transportation, etc.) without explicit statutory authority or executive direction.

This jurisdictional limitation creates a coordination challenge: GovOps houses the expertise in technology (CDT), innovation (ODI), and workforce management (CalHR) that all agencies need, but lacks authority to mandate their use statewide.

**How E3 Expands GovOps Coordination Capability:**

This Enterprise Modernization Plan establishes a framework that enables GovOps to coordinate statewide efficiency and effectiveness initiatives while respecting the autonomy of other cabinet agencies. The E3 model creates this capability through:

**Transformation Management Office (TMO) within GovOps:**
- Housed within GovOps, TMO provides centralized coordination, portfolio management, performance tracking, and support services
- TMO supports (but does not control) E3 Undersecretaries across all agencies
- Services provided: knowledge management, performance analytics, change management support, innovation coordination, Communities of Practice facilitation
- Creates visibility and accountability without exercising direct authority over other agencies
- GovOps provides infrastructure; agencies maintain autonomy

**Statewide E3 Council:**
- Convened through Governor's Office with TMO providing staff support
- Brings together E3 Undersecretaries from all agencies for coordination, alignment, and peer learning
- GovOps Secretary participates but does not direct other agency E3 leaders
- Creates peer network enabling voluntary collaboration and best practice sharing
- Coordination, not command-and-control

**Leveraging GovOps Expertise Statewide:**
- **CDT** provides technology standards, cybersecurity guidance, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise architecture services to all E3 initiatives
- **ODI** provides innovation methods, human-centered design, CalAcademy training, and DIF funding partnerships across all agencies
- **CalHR** provides workforce planning, classification support for data governance teams, and change management guidance statewide
- **DGS** supports procurement innovation, modular contracting, and facilities management for all agencies

The E3 structure transforms GovOps from an agency with limited direct authority into the **coordination hub** for statewide modernization, providing infrastructure, expertise, and support that enables E3 leaders across all agencies to succeed. This respects California's decentralized governance while creating the coordination necessary for enterprise transformation.

```

### 2.2 Undersecretary Positions (Strategic Leadership and Agency Coordination)

**Position Overview:**  
Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness operate at the Agency level, reporting directly to Agency Secretaries while coordinating statewide efforts through the Transformation Management Office and Statewide E3 Council. These positions hold explicit authority over technology modernization, business process optimization, data governance, and performance management within their agencies.

**Why This Position Matters:**
Without Undersecretaries, modernization efforts fragment across departments with no strategic coordination. Individual departments optimize locally but create incompatibilities system-wide. Undersecretaries provide agency-level strategic direction, ensure cross-department interoperability, allocate resources based on enterprise priorities rather than political influence, and create forcing function for consistent progress. They are the difference between coordinated transformation and chaotic fragmentation.

For sample position descriptions and duty statements, see [Appendix A: Sample Templates and Frameworks](appendices.md#appendix-a-sample-templates-and-frameworks).

These are not advisory or coordinator roles. Undersecretaries have authority to approve major technology investments, mandate cross-department data sharing, redirect resources to strategic initiatives, and hold Chief Deputy Directors accountable for results. They serve as the primary interface between their agencies and both ODI and the Office of State Data Governance, ensuring proven methods and mandatory standards are adopted at scale.

### 2.3 Chief Deputy Director Positions (Operational Execution and Department Transformation)

**Position Overview:**  
Chief Deputy Directors for Efficiency and Effectiveness operate within departments, reporting to Department Directors while coordinating with agency-level Undersecretaries and TMO. These positions hold operational responsibility for modernization execution, managing cross-functional teams including data governance staff and embedded Innovation Fellows.

**Why This Position Matters:**  
Department Directors manage complex operations with competing priorities: service delivery, regulatory compliance, budget constraints, legislative mandates, and stakeholder relations. Modernization often falls to the bottom of priority lists without dedicated leadership. Chief Deputy Directors provide persistent focus on transformation, bridging the gap between strategic vision (Undersecretary level) and operational reality (department programs and systems). They translate modernization strategy into tangible improvements citizens experience.

Chief Deputy Directors are hands-on leaders who understand both technology and domain operations. They manage project portfolios, lead business process improvement initiatives, deploy new technologies, ensure data quality, and deliver measurable service improvements. They are the change agents embedded in department operations.

### 2.4 Transformation Management Office (TMO)

**Purpose and Strategic Importance:**  
The TMO provides centralized coordination, portfolio management, performance tracking, and support services essential to the entire modernization initiative. Without TMO, E3 efforts risk becoming fragmented silos where well-intentioned leaders pursue similar solutions in parallel, wasting resources and foregoing economies of scale.

**Why TMO Matters - The Case for Centralized Coordination:**

Government agencies tend toward independent operation. Decentralization has benefits (autonomy, customization, accountability) but also costs. Without coordination:
- **Duplicated Effort:** Multiple agencies build similar solutions independently (identity management, payment processing, document management)
- **Incompatibility:** Independently developed systems cannot interoperate, preventing data sharing and integrated service delivery
- **Missed Learning:** Successful innovations remain siloed; failures repeat across agencies
- **Resource Waste:** Agencies compete for same vendors, driving up costs; cannot achieve volume discounts
- **Invisible Dependencies:** Projects unknowingly depend on other projects, causing cascading delays when dependencies aren't managed

TMO prevents these pathologies by:
- **Creating Visibility:** Single source of truth for all modernization initiatives statewide; everyone knows what everyone else is doing
- **Managing Dependencies:** Identifying where projects rely on each other; preventing conflicts; enabling sequencing
- **Enabling Reuse:** Capturing what works; packaging for adoption by other departments; preventing reinvention
- **Providing Early Warning:** Detecting troubled projects before they fail catastrophically; enabling intervention
- **Building Community:** Connecting E3 leaders for peer learning, mutual support, and collaborative problem-solving

**Organizational Placement:**
- **Reports to:** Government Operations Agency Secretary
- **Coordinates with:** Statewide E3 Council, ODI, CDT, Office of State Data Governance, Department of Finance
- **Supports:** All Undersecretaries and Chief Deputy Directors across all agencies

**Staffing:**
- **Director:** Executive leadership, external representation, agency Secretary interface, Statewide E3 Council staff support

## 3. Independent Office of State Data Governance

### 3.1 Constitutional Model and Precedent

The Independent Office of State Data Governance follows California's Little Hoover Commission model: cross-branch appointments, staggered terms, statutory authority, and independence from any single agency.

**Why Independence Matters:**
- E3 leaders need enforceable data sharing authority, not just coordination roles
- Single-agency governance (e.g., within GovOps) lacks legitimacy across other cabinet agencies
- Legislative/judicial branches require data too; executive-only governance excludes them
- Political transitions shouldn't reset data governance; institutional continuity essential

### 3.2 Board Composition (9 Members Minimum)

**Required Seats:**
1. Governor appointment #1
2. Governor appointment #2  
3. Senate Rules Committee appointment
4. Assembly Speaker appointment
5. Judicial Council appointment
6. UC Regents representative
7. CSU Board representative
8. **Public seat (REQUIRED)** - citizen perspective, accountability
9. **Breakthrough partner / digital industry representative (REQUIRED)** - private sector expertise, co-learning

**Senior Technical Advisor Requirement:**
Each board seat must have an assigned Senior Technical Advisor who provides technical expertise, reviews standards, and advises their appointing member. These advisors should be experienced technology professionals at a senior level (e.g., senior architects, engineering managers, data science leads, or equivalent)—not necessarily holding a formal "Chief" or "Officer" title. This ensures board decisions are technically sound and implementable while allowing flexibility in how appointing authorities staff this advisory function.

**Term Structure:**
- Staggered 3-year terms
- Survives administration transitions
- Cross-branch legitimacy

### 3.3 Authority and Responsibilities

**Binding Powers:**
- Set statewide data standards (schemas, formats, quality rules)
- Approve/mandate data sharing frameworks
- Convene all branches for policy development
- Enforce compliance through budget/procurement mechanisms

**Key Functions:**
- Develop statewide data architecture
- Resolve inter-agency data disputes
- Protect privacy while enabling sharing
- Annual reporting to Legislature

### 3.4 Data Sharing Agreement Templates

**Why Four Template Types Matter:**

Data sharing negotiations currently take 18 months because every agreement is custom. Standardized templates reduce this to 4-8 weeks by providing pre-approved legal language, technical specifications, and risk mitigation approaches for common scenarios. For a complete sample Data Sharing Agreement (Type 3: Moderate Sensitivity), see [Appendix A.2](appendices.md#a2-data-sharing-agreement-template-type-3-moderate-sensitivity).

**Template 1: Public Data Exchange**
- **Use Case:** Sharing non-sensitive data between state agencies for operational purposes (e.g., business registry data, public facility locations, aggregate statistics)
- **Key Features:** Simple MOU, minimal restrictions, attribution requirements, update frequency specified
- **Approval Time:** 2-4 weeks (department-level approval sufficient)
- **Example:** DMV shares aggregate vehicle registration data with Air Resources Board for emissions modeling

**Template 2: Confidential Data with Limited PII**
- **Use Case:** Sharing data containing some PII but not highly sensitive (e.g., permit applications, licensing records, low-risk health data)
- **Key Features:** Data Use Agreement (DUA), access controls, audit logging, breach notification procedures, retention limits
- **Approval Time:** 4-6 weeks (requires Chief Deputy Director + data governance team review)
- **Example:** Occupational Safety shares workplace injury reports with Public Health for epidemiological analysis (PII minimized)

**Template 3: Sensitive Data Requiring Enhanced Protection**
- **Use Case:** Highly sensitive PII or protected classes (criminal justice, child welfare, mental health, financial information)
- **Key Features:** Enhanced DUA, role-based access, encryption requirements, independent privacy review, limited retention, strict purpose limitation
- **Approval Time:** 6-8 weeks (requires Undersecretary + Independent Office privacy review)
- **Example:** Corrections shares inmate release data with Social Services for reentry support program eligibility

**Template 4: Cross-Branch or External Entity Sharing**
- **Use Case:** Sharing between executive/legislative/judicial branches or with federal/local governments, academic institutions, or (rarely) private entities
- **Key Features:** Formal inter-branch agreement, explicit statutory authority cited, strict purpose limitation, public transparency requirements, sunset clauses
- **Approval Time:** 8-12 weeks (requires Independent Office board approval)
- **Example:** Executive branch shares arrest data with Judicial Council for pretrial release research; or sharing Medi-Cal data with federal HHS for program oversight

**Benefits of Templates:**
- **Speed:** 90% reduction in negotiation time
- **Legal clarity:** Pre-vetted language reduces risk
- **Consistency:** Similar use cases treated similarly
- **Transparency:** Public can see standard terms
- **Scalability:** New agreements use proven patterns

## 4. Product-Led Delivery Framework

### 4.1 Service Mesh Architecture

**Vision:** Replace monolithic point-to-point integrations with service mesh where every system exposes APIs and discovers services through a catalog.

**API Standards:**
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0+ specs
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Agency API catalogs for discovery
- Semantic versioning, backward compatibility
- Rate limiting and monitoring

**Implementation:**
1. Pilot with high-value cross-agency services
2. Mandate for all new procurements
3. Retrofit legacy with API wrappers
4. TMO maintains statewide catalog

### 4.2 Citizen Journey Teams

**Organizing Around Life Events:**

Traditional government organizes around agencies. Citizens experience life events that require multiple agencies:
- Having a baby (Health, Vital Records, Social Services, Tax)
- Starting a business (Secretary of State, Tax, Licensing, Permitting)
- Disaster recovery (Emergency Services, Housing, Insurance, Small Business)

Citizen Journey Teams bring together E3 leaders, SMEs, and Fellows from relevant agencies to redesign experiences around these journeys, creating seamless integrated services.

### 4.3 Modular Contracting with California Context

*For policy implementation details including executive order framework, legislative waiver process, and enforcement mechanisms, see [Section 6.1 Modular Contracting](#61-modular-contracting).*

**California's Procurement Evolution:**

California Department of Technology (CDT) has pioneered modern procurement approaches since 2022:
- **Modular Partnership:** Breaking large systems into vendor-independent modules
- **Challenge-Based (RFI²):** Problem statements instead of prescriptive specs
- **eVAQ:** Pre-qualified vendor pools for rapid task orders
- **Modern RFP:** Phased approach with down-selection and negotiation

**The $10 Million Contract Cap:**

The E3 plan establishes $10M as maximum IT contract value to force modularization and reduce risk. For full policy rationale, implementation mechanisms, and enforcement procedures, see [Section 6.1: Modular Contracting](#61-modular-contracting). This section focuses on practical application through a detailed example.

**How $40M Project Works Under $10M Cap:**

**Scenario:** Department needs new case management system estimated at $40M over 3 years.

**Traditional Approach (Single $40M Contract):**
- One vendor, one contract, all-or-nothing
- 18-24 month procurement cycle
- High risk: vendor failure = project failure
- Limited competition: only large system integrators can bid
- Change orders expensive and time-consuming

**Modular Approach (Four $10M Contracts):**

**Contract 1 ($10M): Core Platform**
- Procure foundational infrastructure: database, authentication, user management, API gateway
- Award to vendor with best platform expertise
- Deliverable: Working platform ready for module integration
- Timeline: Months 1-12

**Contract 2 ($10M): Data Migration and Integration**
- Migrate legacy data to new platform
- Build APIs connecting to related systems
- Award to vendor with data migration expertise (may be different vendor)
- Deliverable: Legacy data migrated, systems integrated via APIs
- Timeline: Months 7-18 (overlaps with Contract 1)

**Contract 3 ($10M): User-Facing Applications**
- Build citizen-facing portal and mobile app
- Build staff case management interfaces
- Award to vendor with UX/UI and agile development expertise
- Deliverable: Working applications for citizens and staff
- Timeline: Months 13-24 (after platform ready)

**Contract 4 ($10M): Advanced Features and Support**
- Add analytics, reporting, workflow automation
- Provide 2-year operations and maintenance
- Award to best-value vendor for ongoing support
- Deliverable: Enhanced capabilities and sustained operations
- Timeline: Months 19-36

**Managing Overhead and Integration:**

**Challenge:** Multiple vendors increase coordination costs and integration complexity.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Integration Architect (Department Staff or Small Contract):**
   - Dedicated technical lead ensures modules integrate properly
   - Defines interface specifications before module procurements
   - Reviews vendor designs for compatibility
   - Chairs weekly vendor coordination meetings

2. **API-First Architecture:**
   - All contracts require well-documented APIs
   - Integration through APIs (not tight coupling) reduces coordination
   - Modules can be tested independently before integration

3. **Phased Procurement:**
   - Later contracts benefit from lessons learned in earlier contracts
   - Vendor performance in Contract 1 informs Contract 2-4 vendor selection
   - Requirements refined based on actual platform capabilities

4. **Shared Development Environment:**
   - Department provides unified dev/test environment
   - All vendors work in same environment
   - Integration issues detected early

**Cost Overrun Protection:**

**Traditional Approach Risk:**
- $40M contract has cost overruns
- Vendor submits $15M change order
- Department has no leverage (sunk cost, vendor lock-in)
- Total cost: $55M (38% overrun)

**Modular Approach Protection:**
- Contract 1 has cost overruns
- Department caps overruns at $2M (keeps within $10M envelope or adjusts scope)
- Contracts 2-4 not yet awarded; can adjust scope or budget
- If Contract 1 vendor performs poorly, select different vendors for 2-4
- Total cost controlled to original $40M by scope adjustments across contracts

**Phased Funding Management:**

California budget process requires multi-year appropriations for projects over $5M.

**Year 1 Budget:** $15M appropriated
- Contract 1: $10M awarded and underway
- Contract 2: $5M initial funding, full award pending Year 2 appropriation

**Year 2 Budget:** $15M appropriated  
- Contract 2: Remaining $5M funded
- Contract 3: $10M awarded

**Year 3 Budget:** $10M appropriated
- Contract 4: $10M awarded

**Benefit:** If budget constraints emerge or project priorities shift, future contracts can be delayed, descoped, or cancelled without forfeiting sunk costs in completed modules. Completed modules (Contracts 1-2) still provide value even if Contracts 3-4 are deferred.

**Small Business Participation:**

Modular contracting enables small firms to compete:
- Small firms cannot bid $40M contracts but CAN bid $10M modules
- Contracts 1-3 could go to small/medium vendors
- Contract 4 (O&M support) ideal for small local firms
- Increased competition drives better pricing and innovation

### 4.4 RFI²: Request for Innovative Ideas

California CDT has established RFI² (challenge-based procurement) where departments state problems and vendors propose solutions.

**E3 Expansion of RFI²:**
- Mandatory for all E3-funded projects over $2M
- TMO provides RFI² template and facilitation
- ODI CalInnovate supports problem definition through user research
- Pilot competitions before production awards reduce risk

**Process:**
1. Problem definition (user research, success metrics)
2. Vendor concept papers (5-10 pages)
3. Down-select to 2-3 finalists
4. Paid pilots with real data
5. Award to best-performing pilot

---

## 5. Technology Architecture

For detailed technical standards including API specifications, data exchange formats, cybersecurity controls, and cloud requirements, see [Appendix B: Technology Standards Catalog](appendices.md#appendix-b-technology-standards-catalog).

### 5.1 API Management Strategy

**Centralized API Gateway:**

A unified API gateway provides the entry point for all API traffic, enabling consistent security, monitoring, and governance across California's digital services.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Single entry point for all API traffic (internal and external)
- Enforces authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and logging
- Provides analytics on API usage patterns and performance
- Enables A/B testing and canary deployments for continuous improvement
- Supports versioning and backward compatibility

**Developer Portal:**

A comprehensive developer portal democratizes access to California's government services through well-documented, self-service APIs.

**Features:**
- Unified catalog of all state government APIs (searchable by function, agency, data type)
- Interactive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger specifications)
- Self-service API key provisioning with approval workflows
- Code samples and SDKs in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C#)
- Sandbox environments for testing without production impact
- Support forums and ticketing system for developer assistance
- Usage dashboards showing consumption and performance

**API Classification:**

California establishes three tiers of APIs with appropriate access controls and service levels:

**Public APIs:** Available to any consumer (developers, researchers, businesses, citizens)
- Minimal authentication (API key registration with email verification)
- Generous rate limits (10,000 requests/day per key)
- Published on public developer portal (developer.ca.gov)
- Examples: Business registry lookup, public datasets, geospatial data, licensing information

**Partner APIs:** Available to approved external organizations (contractors, research institutions, local governments)
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with formal approval process
- Moderate rate limits (100,000 requests/day)
- Formal SLA and dedicated support channels
- Examples: Case management systems, benefit eligibility verification, identity verification

**Internal APIs:** Available only to state government systems and authorized staff
- Mutual TLS authentication with certificate management
- High rate limits (1,000,000 requests/day)
- Internal developer portal with additional security documentation
- Examples: PII data access, financial systems, law enforcement databases

**Deployment Target:** 200 APIs published within 2 years (50 public, 50 partner, 100 internal)

### 5.2 Legacy System Modernization

**Strangler Pattern (Preferred Approach):**

California adopts the strangler pattern for legacy modernization, avoiding risky "big bang" replacements in favor of incremental transformation while maintaining operational continuity.

**Process:**
1. **Create API Facade:** Wrap legacy system with API layer providing modern interface to old functionality
2. **Build New Microservice:** Develop cloud-native service replicating one discrete function
3. **Route Intelligently:** Direct new requests to microservice while legacy requests continue to old system
4. **Migrate Gradually:** Incrementally shift functionality to new services based on usage patterns and risk assessment
5. **Decommission Legacy:** Remove legacy system components when usage reaches zero and all functionality migrated

**Benefits:**
- **Lower Risk:** No catastrophic cutover; system remains operational throughout migration
- **Continuous Value:** Users experience improvements incrementally rather than waiting years
- **Course Correction:** Ability to pause, adjust strategy, or pivot based on learnings
- **Service Availability:** Maintains citizen access throughout modernization process
- **Resource Flexibility:** Can accelerate or slow migration based on resource availability and competing priorities

**Sunset Timelines:**

California establishes clear timelines for legacy system retirement based on technical debt and criticality:

- **High technical debt + high criticality:** 2-year maximum lifespan from assessment
- **High technical debt + medium criticality:** 3-year maximum
- **Medium technical debt:** 5-year maximum
- **Automatic review trigger:** Systems exceeding planned lifecycle must justify continuation annually

**Modernization Portfolio Targets:**
- **Year 1:** Complete comprehensive assessment across all departments; decommission 10% of legacy systems (40 systems)
- **Year 2:** Decommission 10% more (20% cumulative); complete API facades for 50 high-priority systems
- **Year 3:** Decommission 10% more (30% cumulative); achieve 50% reduction in legacy technical debt
- **Years 4-5:** Achieve 40% total legacy reduction target while maintaining operational stability

### 5.3 Cloud Strategy

**Hybrid Cloud with On-Premises Redundancy:**

To protect state business operations in the event of internet outage or cloud service disruption, California adopts a hybrid cloud strategy that maintains on-premises redundancy for critical systems.

**Architecture Principles:**

**Cloud-First for New Development:** All new systems deployed to cloud unless specific exception granted based on:
- Data sovereignty requirements (specific statutes mandating on-premises storage)
- Latency requirements incompatible with cloud architecture
- Cost analysis showing on-premises more cost-effective over 5-year horizon
- Security requirements exceeding cloud provider capabilities

**Critical System Redundancy:** Mission-critical systems maintain on-premises backup capability enabling continued operations during cloud outages.

**Hybrid Connectivity:** Secure, redundant connections between cloud and on-premises infrastructure:
- Multiple dedicated interconnects from different providers
- VPN backup connectivity
- Automatic failover between connectivity paths
- Continuous monitoring of connection health

**Multi-Cloud Strategy:** Avoid single cloud vendor lock-in through multi-cloud deployment where feasible:
- Critical applications deployed across multiple cloud providers
- Containerized workloads enabling portability
- Infrastructure-as-Code supporting multi-cloud deployment
- Careful analysis of multi-cloud complexity vs. flexibility benefits

**Critical Systems Requiring On-Premises Redundancy:**

Examples of systems that must maintain on-premises operational capability:

- **Emergency Services:** 911 dispatch, CAL FIRE coordination, emergency management systems, emergency alert systems
- **Law Enforcement:** Criminal justice information systems, arrest and booking systems, warrant management
- **Public Safety:** Prison management systems, probation and parole tracking, sex offender registry
- **Benefits Delivery:** CalFresh, Medi-Cal eligibility, unemployment insurance payments, child support
- **Critical Infrastructure:** Water management systems, power grid coordination, transportation management
- **Financial Systems:** Payroll processing, tax collection, treasury operations, pension management

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Primary workloads run in cloud** for scalability, elasticity, and cost efficiency
- **Critical data replicated to on-premises systems** in near-real-time (typically < 5 minute lag)
- **On-premises systems capable of maintaining operations** during internet disruption (degraded capacity acceptable)
- **Regular failover testing** (quarterly minimum) to ensure redundancy effectiveness
- **Automated failback** when cloud connectivity restored, with data reconciliation
- **Clear procedures** for manual intervention if automated failover fails

**Cloud Provider Requirements:**
- FedRAMP-certified cloud providers (AWS GovCloud, Microsoft Azure Government, Google Cloud Platform)
- FISMA compliance appropriate to data sensitivity (Moderate or High)
- StateRAMP (California-specific requirements including data residency, audit access, breach notification)
- SLA guarantees: 99.9% uptime for production services, 99.99% for critical systems
- Geographic redundancy within California or western United States where possible

**Cloud-Native Architecture:**

California adopts modern cloud-native patterns to maximize cloud benefits:

- **Containers and Orchestration:** Docker containers managed by Kubernetes enabling portability and scaling
- **Serverless Computing:** AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions for event-driven workloads
- **Managed Services:** Leverage cloud provider services reducing operational overhead (managed databases, message queues, caching)
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform or CloudFormation for repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure
- **Automated Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Cloud-native backup with cross-region replication
- **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically adjust capacity based on demand
- **Immutable Infrastructure:** Replace rather than update infrastructure components

**Migration Approach:**
- **Prioritize high-cost, low-complexity workloads first** (quick wins demonstrating value)
- **Use lift-and-shift for initial migration**, then re-architect for cloud-native over time
- **Implement strong cloud governance:** Cost management, security controls, compliance monitoring, tagging standards
- **Data center consolidation** as workloads migrate, reducing facilities costs
- **Hybrid period of 3-5 years** recognizing gradual transition

**Target:** 50% of workloads in cloud by Year 3, with all critical systems maintaining on-premises redundancy

### 5.4 Cybersecurity

**Zero Trust Architecture:**

California transitions from perimeter-based security to Zero Trust, recognizing that threats exist both outside and inside the network.

**Core Principles:**
- **Identity-based access:** Authentication based on user/service identity, not network location
- **Least privilege:** Minimum necessary access for users and systems
- **Assume breach:** Design assuming attackers have network access
- **Verify explicitly:** Authenticate and authorize every access request
- **Continuous verification:** Re-authenticate throughout session, not just at login

**Implementation:**

## 6. Procurement Innovation

**Philosophy:** Cheap, scalable, self-supportable solutions over monolithic enterprise systems

California fundamentally rethinks technology procurement, moving away from massive multi-year contracts toward agile, modular approaches that reduce risk, increase competition, and enable innovation.

### 6.1 Modular Contracting

**The Rule:** No IT contract over $10 million or 3 years without legislative waiver

This section covers the policy rationale and implementation mechanisms for modular contracting. For a practical example showing how a $40M project is decomposed into four $10M contracts, including vendor coordination strategies and phased funding management, see [Section 4.3: Modular Contracting with California Context](#43-modular-contracting-with-california-context).

**Rationale:**

Large, monolithic IT contracts consistently underperform or fail outright. California's history includes multiple failed projects exceeding $100M with minimal value delivered. The $10M modular contracting cap forces better outcomes by:

**Reducing Risk:**
- Smaller contracts mean smaller failures
- Failed module does not jeopardize entire system
- Ability to course correct quickly without massive sunk costs
- Natural checkpoints for go/no-go decisions

**Increasing Competition:**
- Lower contract values accessible to small and mid-size vendors
- More innovative vendors can compete without massive corporate infrastructure
- Reduces dominance of large system integrators
- Multiple vendors can work in parallel on different modules

**Reducing Vendor Lock-In:**
- Modular architecture enables vendor replacement for underperforming components
- Competitive pressure maintains quality and cost discipline
- Avoids situation where vendor effectively holds state hostage

**Enabling "Fail Small and Fast":**
- Failed module costs $5M and 6 months, not $200M and 5 years
- Learnings from failed module inform subsequent attempts
- Political and public tolerance for smaller, less catastrophic failures

**Allowing Course Correction:**
- Technology and requirements change during multi-year projects
- Modular approach allows pivoting to new approaches without abandoning entire investment
- Can incorporate new technologies and best practices as they emerge

**Implementation:**

**Executive Order Establishing Cap:**
- Governor issues EO mandating $10M/3-year maximum for IT contracts
- Exceptions require legislative waiver with public justification
- CDT responsible for enforcement through procurement review

**Legislative Waiver Process:**
- Department must justify why project cannot be decomposed
- Technical review by CDT and TMO
- Public hearing demonstrating stakeholder support
- Approval by joint legislative oversight committee
- Enhanced oversight and reporting for waived projects

**CDT Enforcement:**
- All IT contracts over $1M require CDT review and approval
- Procurement checklist verifying modular approach considered
- Rejection of proposals exceeding cap without waiver
- Regular audit of contract portfolio for compliance

**Template Contracts:**
- Pre-negotiated modular contract templates reducing negotiation time
- Standard terms and conditions appropriate to module size
- Simplified approval process for contracts under $5M

**Vendor Prequalification:**
- Established vendor pools for modules under $1M
- Fast-track approval for pre-qualified vendors
- Quarterly refresh of vendor pools based on performance

**Expected Impact:**
- **50% reduction in average contract size** (from $30M average to $15M)
- **30% increase in small business contract awards** (contracts under $5M)
- **40% reduction in project failure rates** (measured by on-time, on-budget completion with stated functionality)
- **25% reduction in procurement cycle time** (due to simpler, smaller procurements)

### 6.2 RFI² (Request for Innovative Ideas) Process

California pioneered RFI² through Executive Order N-04-19, creating an innovative procurement method that asks vendors to design solutions to complex problems rather than bidding on predefined solutions.

**When to Use RFI²:**

RFI² is appropriate for:
- **Complex technical challenges** without obvious solutions (emerging technologies, novel applications)
- **Emerging technology applications** (AI/ML, blockchain, IoT) where best approach unclear
- **Cross-cutting problems** affecting multiple agencies requiring coordinated solutions
- **High uncertainty** requiring experimentation and learning rather than traditional specification
- **Innovation opportunity** where creative approaches could deliver step-change improvements

RFI² is NOT appropriate for:
- Well-defined requirements with proven solutions
- Commodity purchases (hardware, licenses)
- Time-critical needs requiring immediate procurement
- Low-risk, straightforward implementations

**Phase 1: Innovation Concept Papers**

**Step 1: Problem Statement Development (Weeks 1-4)**

**Internal Workshops:**
- Cross-functional team defines problem without prescribing solutions
- Focus on outcomes, not technologies
- Include program staff, IT staff, E3 leaders, citizen representatives

**Problem Statement Contents:**
- Background and context
- Current state challenges (quantified where possible)
- Desired outcomes (specific, measurable)
- Constraints (budget, timeline, regulatory, technical)
- Evaluation criteria (how proposals will be assessed)
- Available data and systems for integration

**Example Problem Statement:**
> **Challenge:** California issues 500,000+ professional licenses annually across 40+ boards and bureaus. Applicants must navigate fragmented systems, submit duplicate information, and wait months for processing. 60% of applications require manual review due to missing or inconsistent data. We seek innovative approaches to create a unified licensing experience that reduces applicant burden by 50%, accelerates processing time by 60%, and improves data quality to 95%+ accuracy.

**Step 2: Innovation Conference (Week 5)**

**Public Event Format:**
- Half-day event bringing together potential vendors, entrepreneurs, researchers, government staff

- Breakthrough Fund focuses on catalytic project investments, not operating costs
- Sustainable long-term funding for institutional infrastructure
- Clear separation between transformation projects and permanent staffing

### 8.2 Transparency and Public Benefit Framework

**Why Transparency Matters:**

Public-private partnerships require explicit accountability to both taxpayers and investors. Californians must understand how their tax dollars deliver better services. Private partners must understand return on investment. Transparency prevents skepticism and builds trust.

**Public Reporting and Accountability:**

**Quarterly Public Dashboards:**
- All funded projects listed with: title, department, problem statement, funding amount, timeline, current status
- Performance metrics: cost savings realized, services improved, digital adoption rates, citizen satisfaction scores
- Risk flags: projects behind schedule, over budget, or underperforming
- Publicly accessible via dedicated website; no login required

**Annual Portfolio Report:**
- Comprehensive analysis of portfolio performance
- Total capital deployed, realized savings, return on investment
- Key wins and reusable innovations highlighted
- Failures and lessons learned documented (no-blame learning culture)
- Submitted to Legislature, Governor, and public simultaneously

**Legislative Oversight:**
- Annual briefing to relevant legislative committees
- Response to legislative inquiries within 30 days
- Budget change proposals justified with portfolio data

**How the People of California Benefit:**

- **Better Services:** Faster, more accessible, user-friendly government services (online business licensing in days not months, integrated social services reducing repeat paperwork, multilingual accessible interfaces)
- **Reduced Failures:** Fewer failed IT projects wasting tax dollars; modular approach contains failures before they become catastrophic
- **Improved Access:** Digital-first services available 24/7 from any device; rural and underserved communities gain equal access
- **Cost Savings:** Efficiency gains return dollars to General Fund for other priorities or tax relief
- **Transparency:** Public can track every dollar and see results; government accountability increases

**How the Public Sector Benefits:**

- **Modernized Systems:** Legacy systems replaced with maintainable, secure, cloud-based platforms
- **Reduced Technical Debt:** 70-80% IT budget currently consumed by legacy maintenance; modernization releases funds for innovation
- **Better Data Use:** Integrated data enables evidence-based policy, fraud detection, outcome measurement
- **Workforce Empowerment:** Staff equipped with modern tools; job satisfaction improves; talent retention increases
- **Risk Reduction:** Modular approaches, small contracts, and incremental delivery reduce "big bang" project failures

**How the Private Sector Benefits:**

- **Common Technical and Architectural Patterns:** Breakthrough-funded projects establish standardized APIs, data schemas, integration patterns, and design systems that private sector vendors can leverage
- **Easier Integration:** Vendors building solutions for California government benefit from well-documented, consistent technical standards rather than navigating 170 different agency-specific approaches
- **Meeting Unique Governmental Needs:** Private sector gains deep understanding of government constraints (procurement, privacy, accessibility, equity) enabling them to build solutions applicable to other states and jurisdictions
- **Co-Learning Opportunities:** Breakthrough partners participate in retrospectives, design reviews, and innovation showcases; insights transferable to commercial products
- **Replication Potential:** Successful California innovations become templates for other states; vendors can offer proven solutions nationally
- **Market Development:** Demonstrating government modernization viability creates market demand in other jurisdictions

**No Governance Control:**

Breakthrough partners do NOT gain:
- Voting rights on project selection or state policy decisions
- Access to non-public citizen data
- Preferential vendor status in procurements
- Influence over Office of State Data Governance standards

Partnership is financial and technical co-learning, not governance participation.

### 8.3 Feedback Loop and Sustainability Model

**How Projects Generate Ongoing Modernization Capacity:**

**Step 1: Project Delivers Measurable Savings**
- Example: Business licensing automation reduces processing time from 45 days to 3 days
- Staffing reduced from 20 FTE to 8 FTE through automation
- Annual cost reduction: $1.2M (12 FTE × $100K loaded cost)

**Step 2: Department Budget Adjusted**
- Department baseline budget reduced by realized savings ($1.2M annual reduction)
- Budget reduction implemented in subsequent fiscal year after savings validated

**Step 3: Fixed 25% Diverted to Breakthrough Fund**
- 25% of $1.2M = $300K diverted to Breakthrough Fund annually
- 75% ($900K) returns to General Fund for other priorities

**Step 4: Reinvestment Creates Next Generation Projects**
- Accumulated savings fund new modernization projects
- Fund becomes self-sustaining over 5-7 years as project portfolio matures
- Private sector partners can exit once fund reaches self-sustainability, or continue partnership

**Portfolio Management Approach:**

ODI manages Breakthrough Fund using venture capital portfolio principles:

**Risk Diversification:**
- **70% of funding:** Proven approaches with high success probability (replicating successful pilots, scaling working innovations)
- **20% of funding:** Medium-risk innovations with demonstrated feasibility (new technologies, novel process redesigns)
- **10% of funding:** High-risk, high-reward moonshots (emerging AI applications, radical business model changes)

**Stage-Gate Investment:**
- Initial funding: Small pilot/proof-of-concept ($250K-$500K)
- Phase 2: Scaled pilot in 2-3 departments ($1M-$3M)
- Phase 3: Statewide deployment ($5M-$10M)
- Projects advance only after achieving phase milestones; failures stopped early

**Metrics-Driven Decisions:**
- Every project has defined success metrics and decision criteria
- Quarterly reviews assess progress; underperforming projects redirected or terminated
- No "sunk cost fallacy"; willingness to stop projects prevents wasteful continuation

### 8.4 Eligible Project Types

**Breakthrough Fund Prioritizes:**

1. **Cross-Agency Innovations:** Projects requiring coordination across multiple agencies where no single agency can fund alone (integrated eligibility systems, shared identity management, multi-agency disaster dashboards)

2. **Replicable Platforms:** Investments creating tools multiple agencies can use (California Design System, API gateway, data sharing infrastructure, workflow automation templates)

3. **Scaling Proven ODI DIF Projects:** Accelerating successful Data and Innovation Fund pilots to statewide deployment

4. **Emerging Technology Pilots:** Carefully governed experiments with AI, automation, blockchain, IoT where appropriate to government context

5. **Capability Building:** Investments in training infrastructure, Communities of Practice, knowledge management systems that build statewide capacity

**Not Eligible:**
- Single-agency projects that should be funded through department budgets
- Routine IT infrastructure (desktop replacement, network upgrades, standard software licensing)
- Projects lacking clear success metrics or outcome measurement plans
- Vendor-specific solutions creating lock-in
- Projects incompatible with state technology standards or data governance policies

### 9.4 Critical Success Factors

**Executive Commitment (5+ years):**
Sustained engagement from Governor and Agency Secretaries essential. Government transformation requires 7-10 years; early leadership departure derails momentum. Communicate realistic timelines; celebrate incremental wins; maintain focus through political cycles.

**Actual Authority (Not Advisory Roles):**
E3 leaders must have real decision-making power over technology investments, data sharing mandates, procurement approvals, performance accountability. Independent Office provides cross-branch legitimacy and enforceable authority. Without authority, modernization remains optional.

**GovOps Coordination Infrastructure:**
TMO within GovOps must have adequate staffing, authority, and resources to coordinate statewide efforts effectively without micromanaging agency E3 leaders. Balance support with autonomy.

**Readiness-Based Deployment:**
Rigorously use Readiness Assessment framework to sequence investments. Early successes in Tier 1 departments build momentum and credibility. Premature deployment to Tier 3-4 departments creates failures that generate resistance. Invest in capability-building before E3 deployment for low-readiness departments.

**Quick Wins (Year 1):**
Deliver 5-10 visible improvements within first year to build credibility, demonstrate capability, overcome skepticism. Quick wins create coalition for change; absence of wins fuels opposition.

**Measurement Discipline:**
Transparent reporting of progress AND setbacks. Publish metrics even when unfavorable. What gets measured gets managed. Create learning culture where failures are analyzed, not hidden. For the complete KPI framework, OKR methodology, and change management approach, see [Appendix G: Performance and Change Management Framework](appendices.md#appendix-g-performance-and-change-management-framework).

**Talent Development at Scale:**
Fellowship provides surge capacity (60 new leaders annually) but sustainable transformation requires workforce investment through data governance teams, CalAcademy training, and career pathway development.

**ODI Integration:**
Leverage ODI's proven approaches, tools, and expertise. E3 leaders actively partner with ODI, mandate adoption of ODI-developed standards, allocate budget for ODI services. ODI transitions from optional consultant to essential enabler.

### 9.5 Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Independent Office legislation delayed** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Early stakeholder engagement, concurrent legislative and planning work, interim steering committee maintaining momentum if needed |
| **Resistance to change from entrenched interests** | HIGH | HIGH | Innovation Ambassadors in departments, protected learning time, no-blame experimentation zones, union engagement early, quick wins demonstrating value, Readiness Assessment identifying concerns |
| **Political transitions disrupting momentum** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Cross-branch Independent Office structure, bipartisan legislative framing, embedded governance surviving transitions, early wins demonstrating value across political spectrum |
| **Vendor dependencies and lock-in** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Open standards requirements, API-first architecture, modular contracting $10M cap, competitive procurement, avoid proprietary platforms |
| **Fellowship talent retention challenges** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Preferential hiring pathways, executive duty statement integration, ongoing SME network engagement, competitive advancement opportunities, alumni network maintaining connections |
| **Low-readiness departments failing E3 deployment** | MEDIUM | LOW | Readiness Assessment-based deployment sequencing, capacity building before E3 assignment, Tier 3-4 departments receive intensive training before projects, realistic timelines |
| **GovOps coordination challenges across agencies** | MEDIUM | LOW | Clear TMO charter, adequate staffing, Governor's Office support, Statewide E3 Council peer accountability, respect for agency autonomy |
| **Breakthrough Fund project failures** | LOW | MEDIUM | Portfolio diversification (70/20/10 risk allocation), stage-gate governance stopping failing projects early, metrics-driven decisions, no sunk cost fallacy |

### 9.6 Readiness Assessment Framework Summary

The Readiness Assessment is a structured evaluation tool that determines department preparedness for E3 deployment and modernization investments. This framework drives all deployment sequencing and resource allocation decisions throughout the implementation roadmap.

## 10. Conclusion

California stands at a critical juncture. The state can continue operating with fragmented systems, decades-old technology, and organizational structures that perpetuate inefficiency—or it can deliberately create the forcing mechanisms that drive continuous improvement, innovation, and excellence in public service.

This Enterprise Modernization Plan presents a comprehensive, evidence-based roadmap for transformation. By establishing the E3 Operational Model with empowered leadership positions, creating an Independent Office of State Data Governance with cross-branch authority, launching a continuous pipeline of trained innovation leaders through the Fellowship program, and deploying permanent data governance teams across departments, California will institutionalize the capacity for sustained modernization.

**The plan's architecture addresses root causes, not symptoms:**

- **E3 Undersecretaries and Chief Deputy Directors** provide the explicit authority and persistent focus that modernization requires, ending the pattern where transformation efforts fail due to competing priorities and lack of accountability.

- **The Independent Office of State Data Governance** breaks through the 18-month data sharing negotiation cycle, enabling the cross-agency integration that citizens deserve and modern government requires.

- **The Governor's Innovation Fellowship** creates a self-sustaining pipeline producing 60 trained leaders annually, building the human capital necessary for continuous transformation rather than episodic reform.

- **Permanent data governance teams** staffed with blended domain and technical expertise ensure that innovations persist beyond pilot projects, creating sustainable capacity independent of consultants or temporary programs.

- **The Breakthrough Modernization Fund** with its 50/50 public-private partnership and feedback loop reinvestment model demonstrates that government modernization can be financially self-sustaining while delivering measurable citizen benefit.

**California's transformation will be measured not in press releases, but in outcomes:**

- Citizens completing business licensing online in days instead of months
- Integrated eligibility systems eliminating the need to provide the same information to multiple agencies
- Modern cloud-based systems replacing mainframes from the 1970s
- Data sharing agreements executed in weeks instead of 18 months
- 60 new modernization leaders trained annually, creating a multiplying effect across state government
- Documented cost savings demonstrating that efficiency investments pay for themselves

This plan is deliberately structured to create early wins in the first six months, demonstrate measurable impact by twelve months, and achieve enterprise-wide transformation by thirty-six months. The Readiness Assessment framework ensures resources flow to departments positioned for success, creating momentum rather than resistance.

**The plan's transparency and accountability mechanisms distinguish it from past efforts:**

Quarterly public dashboards, annual portfolio reports, transparent performance metrics, and legislative oversight ensure that progress—and setbacks—are visible to all stakeholders. This visibility creates the accountability that drives sustained performance.

**California has the resources, the expertise, and the opportunity to succeed.**

The Office of Data and Innovation has pioneered the methods this plan scales statewide. The Government Operations Agency provides the coordination infrastructure. The California Department of Technology brings technical standards and cybersecurity expertise. Talented state employees throughout California await the tools, authority, and support to drive improvement.

What has been missing is the institutional forcing mechanism—the deliberate organizational design that makes efficiency and effectiveness inevitable rather than optional. This Enterprise Modernization Plan provides that mechanism.

**The choice is clear:**

California can maintain the status quo, accepting 70-80% of IT budgets consumed by legacy system maintenance, accepting 18-month data sharing negotiations, accepting that only 35-40% of transactions are completable online, accepting that citizens must navigate fragmented services and provide the same information repeatedly.

Or California can implement this plan, creating the institutional structures that make continuous improvement, innovation, and excellence the default rather than the exception.

**Government transformation is not a technology problem—it is a leadership and institutional design challenge.** This plan provides both the leadership structure through E3 positions and the institutional design through Independent Office governance, Fellowship talent pipeline, and Breakthrough Fund sustainability model.

California has always led the nation in innovation, scale, and ambition. This Enterprise Modernization Plan positions California to lead the nation in demonstrating that 21st-century government can deliver services with the efficiency of leading private sector organizations while maintaining the transparency, equity, and public purpose that define democratic governance.

The roadmap is clear. The resources are identified. The expertise exists. The only remaining question is commitment—and California has never lacked the courage to pursue ambitious goals in service of its 40 million residents.

**It is time to begin.**
