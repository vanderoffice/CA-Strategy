## Executive Summary

**Prepared for:** Governor's Office, Office of Data and Innovation, Government Operations Agency  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Version:** Executive draft v1.0

## The Challenge

California state government lacks the natural forcing mechanism that drives private sector efficiency. Without the profit motive that compels businesses to optimize or fail, government agencies accumulate technical debt, maintain outdated systems, and perpetuate inefficient processes simply because change introduces risk without consequences for inaction.

The result is measurable: legacy systems consume 70-80% of IT budgets, leaving minimal funds for innovation. Procurement cycles average 18-24 months. Citizens experience fragmented services requiring navigation of organizational charts rather than seamless support for life events. The average critical government system is over 25 years old.

California cannot wait for organic improvement. The state must deliberately create the forcing mechanism that drives efficiency and effectiveness through institutional design.

---

## The Solution: The E3 Operational Model

The **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model** creates institutional accountability for modernization through explicit leadership positions with authority over technology, process, and organizational transformation.

### Three Integrated Components

**1. Institutional Accountability (The Engine)**

New leadership positions create the forcing mechanism government inherently lacks:

- **Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness** at the Agency level with authority over technology modernization, business process optimization, data governance, and performance management
- **Chief Deputy Directors for Efficiency and Effectiveness** at the Department level executing operational transformation and managing project portfolios
- **Transformation Management Office** coordinating efforts statewide, managing the project portfolio, tracking performance, and providing change management support

**2. Product-Led Delivery (The Method)**

Replace project-centric "waterfall" approaches with continuous product delivery:

- **Service Mesh Architecture** connecting systems via APIs instead of monolithic centralized databases
- **Modular Contracting** with a $10 million cap on IT contracts to reduce vendor lock-in and enable smaller, innovative firms to compete
- **RFI² Procurement** (Request for Innovative Ideas) defining problems and soliciting solutions rather than prescribing specific technologies
- **Cross-agency collaboration** through teams organized around citizen journeys (having a baby, starting a business, disaster recovery) rather than agency boundaries

**3. Data Governance Foundation (The Catalyst)**

Establish a cross-branch, independent Office of State Data Governance modeled on California's Little Hoover Commission:

- **Board Composition:** Appointments from Governor, Legislature, Judicial Council, Constitutional Officers, public members, and digital industry representatives ensuring cross-branch legitimacy
- **Authority:** Set statewide data standards, approve sharing frameworks, convene all branches for policy development
- **Durability:** Survives administration transitions with staggered 3-year board terms
- **Actual Power:** E3 leaders gain enforceable authority over data sharing and standardization, not just coordination responsibilities

This independent structure provides the E3 model with actual authority over efficiency and effectiveness, not just advisory roles.

## The Role of the Office of Data and Innovation

The **Office of Data and Innovation (ODI)**, established on July 1, 2019 within the Government Operations Agency and elevated to a standalone department on July 1, 2023, has pioneered innovative approaches to government service delivery through data, human-centered design, and technology. ODI's mission is to drive innovation across California state government to achieve exceptional, equitable outcomes for all Californians.

### ODI's Critical Role in This Plan

**Current ODI Functions:**
- Data and Innovation Fund (DIF) supporting department-level transformation projects
- CalAcademy providing training in human-centered design, data, and innovation practices
- CalInnovate advancing service design and user research
- Statewide Chief Data Officer leading data governance initiatives
- CalData managing California's open data portal

**How This Plan Expands and Strengthens ODI's Impact:**

This Enterprise Modernization Plan establishes a strategy to expand Government Operations Agency accountability to include E3 principles, which apply statewide across all agencies and departments. While GovOps is currently limited in jurisdiction primarily to its 13 constituent departments and offices, the E3 model creates a coordinated framework that enables statewide transformation while respecting agency autonomy.

ODI will serve as the innovation engine and capacity-building hub supporting E3 leaders across all agencies. The plan positions ODI to:

- **Scale proven approaches statewide** through E3 Undersecretaries and Chief Deputy Directors who can mandate adoption of ODI-developed tools, practices, and standards across their agencies
- **Coordinate the Governor's Innovation Fellowship Program** providing continuous talent pipeline that embeds ODI methods throughout state government
- **Support the Transformation Management Office** with performance analytics, knowledge management, and change management expertise
- **Partner with the Independent Data Governance Office** as the technical implementation arm for statewide data standards and sharing frameworks
- **Leverage the Breakthrough Modernization Fund** to accelerate high-impact DIF projects and create replicable models

The E3 structure provides ODI with empowered champions at every agency who have authority to implement ODI recommendations, allocate resources to ODI partnerships, and mandate adoption of ODI standards—transforming ODI from an optional partner to an essential enabler of statewide modernization.

---

## Talent Pipeline and Sustainability

### Governor's Innovation Fellowship

A continuous talent pipeline feeds the E3 structure:

- **5-month cohorts** of 20 fellows launched every 10 months (2-month overlap between cohorts)
- **Department embedding** for hands-on experience outside home agencies
- **Group initiatives** organized as 4 teams of 5 fellows delivering cross-agency modernization solutions
- **Post-fellowship engagement** as on-call subject matter experts and emergency response capacity
- **Preferential hiring** into E3 and other executive positions, with fellowship completion as desirable qualification in duty statements
- **Host department surrogates** ensuring business continuity and sustainable succession planning

By the end of Year 2, four cohorts provide 80 trained modernization leaders actively engaged across state government, with an ongoing pipeline producing 24 new fellows annually thereafter.

### Data Governance Teams

Permanent state staff teams providing sustainable capacity:

- **Leadership by domain experts** utilizing Supervising Engineer, Supervising Geologist, Environmental Program Manager, or equivalent classifications capable of managing Senior-level technical specialists
- **Blended expertise model** integrating licensed professionals (Engineers, Geologists, Environmental Scientists) with dedicated data professionals (Research Data Specialists at senior/supervisory levels)
- **Science classifications in leadership** provide higher compensation, strong critical thinking skills, and data expertise requisite to scientific practice
- **Professional accountability** through supervisory classification standards and professional licensure where applicable
- **Scalable structure** adaptable to any department using equivalent classification series

These teams support Fellows' projects and sustain innovations after Fellows complete their assignments.

---

## Breakthrough Funding Model

The **California Breakthrough Modernization Fund** creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop where efficiency gains generate ongoing modernization capacity.

**Seed Investment:**
- 50/50 partnership between State of California and private sector partners
- Combined initial fund: $100 million total ($50M state, $50M private)
- State separately funds all permanent positions through ongoing General Fund contributions
- Creates "Innovation Sidecar Fund" co-investing with state dollars

**Transparency and Public Benefit:**
Clear accountability mechanisms ensure both Californians and investors understand benefits:
- **Public reporting:** Quarterly public dashboards showing all funded projects, status, and outcomes
- **Benefit tracking:** Documented cost savings returned to General Fund, service improvements, and digital adoption metrics
- **Private sector ROI:** Co-learning opportunities, replicable innovation patterns, and demonstration of government modernization models applicable to other states
- **Legislative oversight:** Annual comprehensive reports to Legislature with detailed portfolio performance

**Feedback Loop:**
- Projects demonstrate efficiency gains and cost savings
- Department baseline budgets reduced to reflect realized efficiencies
- **Fixed 25%** of released funding diverted into Breakthrough Fund
- Remainder (75%) returns to General Fund, providing both fiscal benefit and replenished modernization pool

**Portfolio Reporting:**
- ODI manages fund using private-sector portfolio approach
- Annual "Modernization Portfolio Report" showing deployed capital, realized savings, key wins, and reusable components
- Breakthrough partners receive granular dashboards emphasizing co-learning and replication, not governance control

This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where each successful modernization generates capacity for the next.

## Readiness Assessment Framework

The **Readiness Assessment** is a comprehensive evaluation tool that determines department preparedness for E3 deployment and modernization investments. Located at `/Users/slate/Documents/GitHub/CA-Strategy/readiness-assessment`, this framework provides structured analysis across six critical domains:

**Assessment Domains:**
1. **Leadership and Governance** (25% weight) - Executive sponsorship, strategic alignment, governance maturity
2. **Data and Technology Infrastructure** (25% weight) - Cloud adoption, API maturity, data governance
3. **Organizational Culture and Workforce** (20% weight) - Change readiness, digital literacy, modern talent
4. **Cybersecurity and Risk** (15% weight) - Policy compliance, security governance
5. **Service Delivery** (10% weight) - Digital service maturity, user-centered design
6. **Funding and Portfolio Management** (5% weight) - Project management maturity, investment readiness

**Readiness Tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (Score 4.0-5.0):** Ready for immediate E3 deployment and modernization funding
- **Tier 2 (Score 3.0-3.9):** Ready with targeted support; specific capability gaps addressed
- **Tier 3 (Score 2.0-2.9):** Requires 6-12 month capacity building before E3 deployment
- **Tier 4 (Score < 2.0):** Fundamental organizational development required

**How Readiness Assessment Drives Implementation:**

The assessment informs every phase of the modernization plan:

- **E3 Deployment Prioritization:** Tier 1 departments receive Chief Deputy Directors first, creating early wins and demonstrating value
- **Fellowship Placements:** Fellows embedded in Tier 1-2 departments where they can succeed; Tier 3-4 departments receive capacity-building support first
- **Breakthrough Fund Allocation:** Projects from Tier 1 departments prioritized for funding; Tier 2-3 departments receive conditional funding with capability-building requirements
- **Data Governance Team Deployment:** Pilot teams deployed to Tier 1 departments to establish models; lessons learned inform Tier 2-3 deployments
- **Training Investments:** Tier 3-4 departments receive intensive CalAcademy training and change management support before E3 deployment
- **Risk Mitigation:** Low-readiness departments identified early, avoiding project failures and enabling targeted interventions

Each quarter, departments re-assess using the framework, tracking progress and demonstrating improvement over time. This creates accountability, transparency, and a data-driven approach to resource allocation.

## Critical Success Factors

**Executive Commitment**
Sustained engagement from Governor and Agency Secretaries for 5+ years. Government transformation requires 7-10 years on average; early leadership departure derails momentum.

**Actual Authority**
E3 leaders must have real decision-making power over technology investments, data sharing mandates, and performance accountability—not merely advisory roles. The Independent Office model provides this authority.

**Readiness-Based Deployment**
Use the Readiness Assessment framework to sequence E3 deployment, ensuring early successes build momentum rather than early failures creating resistance.

**Quick Wins**
Deliver 5-10 visible improvements within Year 1 to build credibility, demonstrate capability, and overcome skepticism.

**Measurement Discipline**
Transparent reporting of progress and setbacks. Publish metrics even when unfavorable. What gets measured gets managed.

**Talent Development**
The Fellowship creates a pipeline, but sustained capability requires workforce investment at scale through data governance teams and training programs.

**ODI Integration**
Leverage ODI's proven approaches, tools, and expertise by ensuring E3 leaders actively partner with ODI and mandate adoption of ODI-developed standards and practices.

## Conclusion

California's government modernization challenge is fundamentally an organizational design problem, not merely a technology problem. The E3 Operational Model creates the forcing mechanism for efficiency that government inherently lacks, ensuring sustained focus on effectiveness and continuous improvement.

By establishing the Independent Office of State Data Governance with actual cross-branch authority, launching the Governor's Innovation Fellowship as a continuous talent pipeline, deploying professional data governance teams for sustainable capacity, creating the Breakthrough Modernization Fund for catalytic investment and reinvestment, and leveraging ODI's proven innovation approaches through empowered E3 champions, California establishes a comprehensive, replicable approach to government transformation.

The Readiness Assessment framework ensures strategic, risk-mitigated deployment that builds momentum through early wins rather than undermining credibility through premature failures.

Success requires executive commitment, actual authority structures, readiness-based deployment, measurement discipline, and integration of ODI's innovation expertise. This plan provides the roadmap; execution determines whether California realizes its potential as the national model for 21st-century government effectiveness.

**The question is not whether California can afford to modernize—it's whether California can afford not to.**
