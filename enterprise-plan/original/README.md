# Original Strategy: Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3)

This folder contains the initial comprehensive strategy for modernizing the California State Government. The core philosophy of this phase is that government lacks a natural "profit motive" to drive efficiency, and therefore requires a designed "forcing mechanism" to ensure continuous improvement.

## Core Concept: The E3 Operational Model

The **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3)** model proposes a new leadership structure to drive change:

- **Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness:** New roles at the Agency level (Governor's Office) to coordinate statewide initiatives.
- **Chief Deputy Directors:** New roles at the Department level to execute modernization projects.
- **Governor's Innovation Fellowship:** A talent pipeline to staff these high-impact roles with private sector innovators.

## Key Documents

- **`Executive-Brief.md`**: The primary strategy document. It outlines the problem (lack of forcing mechanism), the solution (E3 model), and the implementation plan (4 phases).
- **`Strategy-Report-Part1.md` - `Part3.md`**: A detailed breakdown of the strategy, including:
  - **Part 1:** The Case for Change & The E3 Model.
  - **Part 2:** Implementation Roadmap & Pilot Projects.
  - **Part 3:** Governance, Risk Management, and Financials.
- **`Presentation-Slides.md` & `Presentation-Outline.md`**: Materials designed for presenting the E3 strategy to executive stakeholders.
- **`Templates-Frameworks.md`**: Operational templates for the proposed "Transformation Management Office," including project charters and KPI dashboards.
- **`Strategic-Critique.md`**: An internal critique of the strategy, likely used to inform the subsequent "Rev1G3" pivot.

## Implementation Approach

The strategy proposes a "Project-Centric" approach:

1.  **Foundation:** Establish governance and launch 10 pilot projects.
2.  **Scale:** Expand pilots and deploy core infrastructure (API Gateway, ESB).
3.  **Transformation:** Full production rollout and legacy system retirement.
4.  **Sustainability:** Transfer governance to permanent structures.
