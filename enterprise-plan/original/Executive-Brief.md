## Executive Brief

**Prepared for:** Office of Data and Innovation, Governor's Office of Operations  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Classification:** Strategic Planning Document

## Executive Summary

California state government faces a fundamental challenge that distinguishes it from the private sector: the absence of a profit-driven forcing mechanism for efficiency and effectiveness. While private companies must optimize operations to survive in competitive markets, government agencies operate without this inherent pressure, leading to accumulated inefficiencies, technical debt, and suboptimal service delivery.

The **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model** creates the structural forcing mechanism California needs by establishing new leadership positions—Undersecretaries at the Governor's Office level and Chief Deputy Directors at department levels—with explicit accountability for modernization, efficiency, and operational excellence. These positions, staffed preferentially from the Governor's Innovation Fellowship Program, serve as the institutional drivers of continuous improvement.

This modernization strategy transforms California's technology infrastructure, data systems, procurement processes, and organizational culture while positioning the state as a national model for government innovation. Through integration with the California Breakthrough Project advisory partnership and leveraging California's pioneering Request for Innovative Ideas (RFI²) procurement method, this approach delivers measurable improvements in citizen services, operational efficiency, and government effectiveness.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 75% of government transactions available digitally by 2028
- 40% reduction in legacy system technical debt within 5 years
- 85%+ citizen satisfaction scores for digital services
- $250M+ in documented cost savings and avoidance by Year 3
- National leadership position as open-source model for other states

## The Problem: Government Without a Profit Motive

Private sector organizations face existential pressure to operate efficiently. Poor performance leads to lost revenue, declining market share, and ultimately business failure. This forcing mechanism drives continuous optimization of processes, technology investments, and workforce development.

Government agencies lack this inherent pressure. Budget allocations continue regardless of efficiency levels. Technology systems remain operational decades beyond their useful life. Processes persist unchanged simply because "we've always done it this way." Citizens have no alternative service providers, creating a captive customer base with limited leverage for demanding improvement.

The consequences are measurable:
- Legacy systems consuming 70-80% of IT budgets, leaving minimal funds for innovation
- Duplicative data systems across agencies preventing information sharing
- Procurement processes taking 18-24 months from requirement definition to contract award
- Digital services adoption lagging private sector equivalents by 5-10 years
- Cybersecurity vulnerabilities from outdated infrastructure
- Workforce skill gaps as technical talent migrates to higher-paying private sector roles

California cannot rely on organic improvement. **The state must deliberately create the forcing mechanism that drives efficiency and effectiveness through institutional design.**

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation
Establish E3 governance structure and leadership positions. Complete skills gap analysis and launch training programs. Select and initiate 10 pilot projects mixing quick wins (90-day delivery) with strategic initiatives. Implement Project Portfolio Management (PPM) system. Complete legacy system inventory and assessment.

**Key Milestone:** Demonstrate 5-10 visible improvements generating momentum and credibility.

### Phase 2: Scale
Expand successful pilots to production deployment. Launch API gateway and Enterprise Service Bus. Operationalize statewide data governance framework. Achieve 25% legacy system migration. Reach 50% digital adoption for high-volume services.

**Key Milestone:** Establish working interoperability between previously siloed systems.

### Phase 3: Transformation
Full production rollout of core platforms. Complete 50% legacy system reduction. Achieve 75% digital service adoption. Mature agile/DevOps practices across all agencies. Demonstrate $250M+ in cost savings and avoidance.

**Key Milestone:** Measurable citizen satisfaction improvements and documented efficiency gains.

### Phase 4: Sustainability
Complete legacy system decommissioning. Achieve all target KPIs. Transfer governance to permanent structures. Document playbooks for continuous modernization. Position California as national leader and open-source model for other states.

**Key Milestone:** Self-sustaining transformation capability embedded in organizational culture.

## Critical Success Factors

**Executive Commitment:** Governor and Agency Secretaries must maintain active engagement for 5+ years. Government transformation requires 7-10 years on average; early leadership departure derails momentum.

**Adequate Funding:** Modernization cannot occur on declining budgets. Clear ROI projections justify increased investment, but appropriations must align with ambition.

**Cultural Transformation:** Technology represents 30% of transformation; people and process account for 70%. Change management investment must match technical investment.

**Quick Wins:** Deliver 5-10 visible improvements within Year 1 to build credibility, demonstrate capability, and overcome skepticism.

**Measurement Discipline:** Transparent reporting of progress and setbacks. What gets measured gets managed; publish metrics even when unfavorable.

**Partnership Approach:** Government cannot execute alone. Engage California Breakthrough Project advisors, private sector vendors, academic institutions, and peer states.

**Talent Development:** Governor's Innovation Fellowship creates a pipeline, but sustained capability requires workforce investment at scale through the Digital Accelerators Program.
