# California State Government Technology Readiness Assessment
## Executive Summary

---

## Purpose and Context

California faces a critical challenge in modernizing the technology infrastructure across its 170 state government departments. With limited modernization funding available through the California Department of Technology's (CDT) Technology Modernization Fund and state budget allocations, it is essential to identify and prioritize departments that possess the organizational readiness to immediately begin modernization work and deliver successful outcomes.

This assessment framework provides a standardized, objective methodology to evaluate organizational readiness across all California state departments. By measuring key dimensions of technological maturity, institutional capacity, and execution readiness, this assessment enables data-driven allocation of modernization funding to departments most likely to succeed and deliver tangible value to California residents.

## Strategic Importance

The State of California has made significant investments in digital transformation through initiatives such as **Envision 2026**, the **State Digital Strategy**, and the **Technology Modernization Fund**. However, not all departments are equally prepared to execute complex modernization projects. Past experience has demonstrated that organizational readiness—including leadership commitment, technical infrastructure, workforce capability, and project management maturity—is as critical to project success as the availability of funding.

### Alignment with California's Technology Goals

This assessment directly supports California's strategic technology objectives:

**Advancing an Inclusive Digital Experience**
- Prioritizes departments that can deliver user-centered digital services
- Ensures technology investments improve accessibility and equity for all Californians
- Focuses resources on departments committed to inclusive service design

**Securing Technology Investments**
- Identifies departments with mature cybersecurity and risk management practices
- Reduces risk of security incidents and data breaches
- Ensures compliance with state security mandates (SAM/SIMM 5300)

**Strengthening the Technology Workforce**
- Recognizes departments with modern skills and change-ready cultures
- Supports workforce development through capability assessment
- Identifies training and capacity-building opportunities

**Aligning Strategy and Execution**
- Ensures funding flows to departments with governance structures that support modernization
- Connects technology investments to strategic plans and measurable outcomes
- Promotes transparency and accountability in technology decision-making

## Implementation Approach

The assessment is designed for practical implementation across California's diverse government landscape, balancing rigor with efficiency.

### Self-Assessment with Validation

**Approach:** Departments complete the assessment internally using their subject matter expertise and institutional knowledge.

**Validation:** Results are subject to review and validation by CDT or designated oversight bodies through documentation review, interviews, and comparative analysis.

**Benefits:**
- Leverages department expertise and contextual knowledge
- Reduces assessment burden on central oversight agencies
- Builds department ownership and commitment to improvement
- Enables honest reflection on capabilities and gaps

### Standardized Scoring Methodology

**Approach:** Each indicator uses clearly defined 1-5 scales with specific examples for anchor points (scores 1, 3, and 5).

**Consistency:** Detailed scoring rubrics with concrete scenarios ensure consistency across all 170 departments regardless of size, mission, or complexity.

**Benefits:**
- Comparable results across diverse departments
- Reduced scoring ambiguity and subjectivity
- Easier validation and quality assurance
- Clear expectations for improvement

### Weighted Domains

**Approach:** Assessment results can be weighted based on strategic priorities (e.g., security compliance may be weighted more heavily than other factors depending on state priorities).
