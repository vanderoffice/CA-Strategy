# Technology Readiness Assessment Framework

**A standardized methodology for evaluating California government departments' readiness for technology modernization.**

---

## Overview

California faces a critical challenge: modernizing technology infrastructure across **170 state departments** with limited funding. This assessment framework provides an objective, data-driven approach to:

- Identify departments ready for immediate modernization
- Prioritize funding allocation based on capability
- Reduce risk of project failures
- Establish improvement roadmaps for all departments

## Scoring Methodology

### Maturity Scale (1-5)

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Initial | Ad hoc, reactive, no formal processes |
| **2** | Emerging | Basic awareness, inconsistent practices |
| **3** | Developing | Defined processes, partial implementation |
| **4** | Managed | Consistent execution, measurable outcomes |
| **5** | Optimized | Continuous improvement, industry-leading |

### Implementation Approach

1. **Self-Assessment**: Departments complete using institutional knowledge
2. **Validation**: CDT reviews through documentation and interviews
3. **Weighted Scoring**: Domains weighted by strategic priorities
4. **Actionable Results**: Specific gaps identified with improvement paths
