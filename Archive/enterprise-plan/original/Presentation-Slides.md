# California State Government Modernization Strategy

## The Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model

**Prepared for:** Office of Data and Innovation & Governor's Office of Operations

---

# Executive Summary

## Transforming California Government for the 21st Century

- **Problem:** Government lacks the profit-driven forcing mechanism that drives private sector efficiency
- **Solution:** The E3 Operational Model creates institutional accountability through new leadership positions
- **Acceleration:** Integration with Governor's Innovation Fellowship and California Breakthrough Project
- **Outcomes:**
  - 75% digital service adoption
  - 85%+ citizen satisfaction
  - $250M+ cost savings by Year 3

<!-- note:
- Start with the core problem: government efficiency without profit motive
- Connect to citizen frustration with current service delivery
- Position E3 as structural solution, not just technology initiative
- Emphasize California as national model for other states
-->

---

# The Efficiency Challenge

## Government Without a Profit Motive

- **Private Sector:** Poor efficiency → lost revenue → business failure (forcing mechanism exists)
- **Government:** Budget allocations continue regardless of efficiency (no inherent pressure)
- **Consequences:**
  - 70-80% of IT budget on legacy systems
  - 18-24 month procurement cycles
  - Outdated infrastructure
- **Conclusion:** California must deliberately create the forcing mechanism through institutional design

<!-- note:
- Acknowledge this is uncomfortable truth about government operations
- Not a criticism of employees—systemic problem requiring systemic solution
- Use specific examples: DMV wait times, redundant forms, outdated systems
- Frame as opportunity, not blame
-->

---

# The E3 Operational Model

## Creating Institutional Accountability

- **Statewide Coordination:** New Undersecretary positions at Governor's Office/Agency level
- **Operational Execution:** Chief Deputy Director positions at department level
- **Authority:** Explicit authority over technology, data, procurement, and performance
- **Talent Pipeline:** Staffed preferentially from Governor's Innovation Fellowship (proven delivery capability)

<!-- note:
- Walk through architecture diagram highlighting key components
- Explain how dual-track structure ensures both strategic oversight and tactical execution
- Emphasize preferential hiring from Fellowship creates merit-based talent pipeline
- Connect to California Breakthrough Project advisory role
-->

---

# Governance Structure

## Multi-Layered Governance Ensuring Accountability

1. **Statewide E3 Council:** Coordinates across agencies (Undersecretaries + GovOps)
2. **Executive Technology Council:** Provides strategic direction (Agency Secretaries)
3. **Technical Architecture Review Board:** Ensures standards compliance
4. **Transformation Management Office (TMO):** Centralized support and tracking
5. **California Breakthrough Project:** Silicon Valley expertise

<!-- note:
- Emphasize this is not more bureaucracy—each layer has specific purpose
- TMO reduces burden on agencies by providing shared services
- Breakthrough Project provides world-class private sector perspective
- Governance enables coordination while preserving agency autonomy
-->

---

# Technology Architecture Highlights

## Modern, Interoperable, Secure Infrastructure

- **Integration:** Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) enables hub-and-spoke vs. spaghetti
- **Access:** API-first architecture with centralized gateway and developer portal
- **Modernization:** Legacy system modernization using strangler pattern (incremental replacement)
- **Security:** Cloud-native infrastructure and Zero Trust security

<!-- note:
- Use simple language; avoid technical jargon for executive audience
- Focus on business benefits: faster integration, lower cost, better security
- Explain strangler pattern prevents "big bang" failures
- UK Government reduced integration time 60% using similar approach
-->

---

# Data Governance Framework

## Statewide Data Governance Enabling Collaboration

- **Structure:** Three-tier data governance (Statewide CDO Council → Agency Teams → Department Stewards)
- **Speed:** Standardized data sharing agreement templates reduce negotiation from 18 months to 30 days
- **Quality:** Master Data Management (MDM) creates "golden records" for citizens, businesses, locations
- **Trust:** Privacy and ethics framework ensures CCPA compliance and responsible AI use

<!-- note:
- Data sharing currently major barrier to integrated services
- Template approach proven successful in other states (Connecticut 45% silo reduction)
- MDM prevents "same person, different ID in every system" problem
- Privacy protection is requirement, not afterthought
-->

---

# Procurement Modernization

## The RFI² Innovation

- **Origin:** California pioneered RFI² under Executive Order N-04-19 (2019)
- **Process:** Innovation Concept Papers → Proof of Concept → Implementation
- **Philosophy:** Asks vendors to design solutions, not just bid on predefined specs
- **Successes:** Wildfire response (131 proposals), Middle-Mile Broadband (83% of network), GenAI bill analysis

<!-- note:
- Explain traditional procurement defines solution upfront (limits innovation)
- RFI² flips model: define problem, let market innovate
- Vendor compensation for concept papers ensures quality participation
- Ideal for complex, high-uncertainty challenges where best solution unknown
- Position as California innovation other states can adopt
-->

---

# Workforce Strategy

## Developing Talent for Modern Government

- **Digital Accelerators Program:** Training all IT staff in cloud, AI/ML, agile, cybersecurity
- **Governor's Innovation Fellowship:** 6-month delivery program with preferential E3 hiring
- **Protected Learning Time:** 20% of work hours dedicated to skill development
- **Compensation:** Competitive packages addressing private sector gaps (20-40%)

<!-- note:
- Acknowledge talent is California's biggest challenge
- Cannot compete on salary alone, but total package (pension, mission, work-life balance) is competitive
- Fellowship creates "try before you buy" talent pipeline
- 33% of government workers have low digital skills; training is non-negotiable
- GDIT trained 20,000+ employees successfully—California can too
-->

# Performance Measurement Approach

## Rigorous Measurement and Transparent Accountability

- **Four-Tier KPI Framework:**
  - Strategic (citizen-facing)
  - Operational (technical)
  - Transformation (program health)
  - Organizational (culture)
- **Focus:** OKR (Objectives & Key Results) quarterly focus aligned with Envision 2026
- **Transparency:** Public dashboard showing real-time progress
- **Reporting:** Quarterly executive reports to Governor and Legislature

<!-- note:
- What gets measured gets managed—discipline is critical
- Public transparency prevents window-dressing and creates accountability
- OKRs provide quarterly focus preventing drift
- Learn from both successes and failures (report honestly)
-->

---

# Phased Implementation Roadmap

## Disciplined, Phased Approach Delivering Continuous Value

- **Phase 1 - Foundation:** Establish governance, assess current state, launch 10 pilots
- **Phase 2 - Scale:** Deploy ESB/APIs, expand E3 leadership, 25% legacy migration
- **Phase 3 - Transformation:** Full platform deployment, 50% legacy reduction, $250M+ ROI
- **Phase 4 - Sustainability:** Complete modernization, embed in culture, national leadership

<!-- note:
- Transformation takes 7-10 years on average—must set realistic expectations
- Phased approach enables learning and course correction
- Early wins in Phase 1 critical for building momentum and credibility
- Each phase builds on previous, not discrete initiatives
-->

---

# Quick Wins Strategy

## Delivering Visible Improvements in First 90 Days

- **Strategy:** 5-7 "quick win" projects: 90-day delivery, visible impact, low complexity
- **Examples:** Digitize paper forms, deploy chatbot, automate reports, e-signatures
- **Goals:** Build credibility, demonstrate capability, overcome skepticism, generate momentum
- **Balance:** Pair with 3-5 strategic pilots (longer timeline, foundational capabilities)

<!-- note:
- Government IT has reputation for long timelines and failures
- Quick wins prove E3 model can deliver rapidly
- Choose projects with high visibility to citizens or frontline staff
- Success breeds success—early wins create coalition for larger changes
-->
