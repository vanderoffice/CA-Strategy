# California Enterprise Modernization Plan
## Executive Summary

**Prepared for:** Governor's Office, Office of Data and Innovation, Government Operations Agency  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Version:** Executive draft v1.0

---

## The Challenge

California state government lacks the natural forcing mechanism that drives private sector efficiency. Without the profit motive that compels businesses to optimize or fail, government agencies accumulate technical debt, maintain outdated systems, and perpetuate inefficient processes simply because change introduces risk without consequences for inaction.

The result is measurable: legacy systems consume 70-80% of IT budgets, leaving minimal funds for innovation. Procurement cycles average 18-24 months. Citizens experience fragmented services requiring navigation of organizational charts rather than seamless support for life events. The average critical government system is over 25 years old.

California cannot wait for organic improvement. The state must deliberately create the forcing mechanism that drives efficiency and effectiveness through institutional design.

---

## The Solution: The E3 Operational Model

The **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model** creates institutional accountability for modernization through explicit leadership positions with authority over technology, process, and organizational transformation.

### Three Integrated Components

**1. Institutional Accountability (The Engine)**

New leadership positions create the forcing mechanism government inherently lacks:

- **Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness** at the Agency level with authority over technology modernization, business process optimization, data governance, and performance management
- **Chief Deputy Directors for Efficiency and Effectiveness** at the Department level executing operational transformation and managing project portfolios
- **Transformation Management Office** coordinating efforts statewide, managing the project portfolio, tracking performance, and providing change management support

**2. Product-Led Delivery (The Method)**

Replace project-centric "waterfall" approaches with continuous product delivery:

- **Service Mesh Architecture** connecting systems via APIs instead of monolithic centralized databases
- **Modular Contracting** with a $10 million cap on IT contracts to reduce vendor lock-in and enable smaller, innovative firms to compete
- **RFI² Procurement** (Request for Innovative Ideas) defining problems and soliciting solutions rather than prescribing specific technologies
- **Cross-agency collaboration** through teams organized around citizen journeys (having a baby, starting a business, disaster recovery) rather than agency boundaries

**3. Data Governance Foundation (The Catalyst)**

Establish a cross-branch, independent Office of State Data Governance modeled on California's Little Hoover Commission:

- **Board Composition:** Appointments from Governor, Legislature, Judicial Council, Constitutional Officers, public members, and digital industry representatives ensuring cross-branch legitimacy
- **Authority:** Set statewide data standards, approve sharing frameworks, convene all branches for policy development
- **Durability:** Survives administration transitions with staggered 3-year board terms
- **Actual Power:** E3 leaders gain enforceable authority over data sharing and standardization, not just coordination responsibilities

This independent structure provides the E3 model with actual authority over efficiency and effectiveness, not just advisory roles.

---

## The Role of the Government Operations Agency

The **Government Operations Agency (GovOps)** serves as California's management and efficiency agency, established on July 1, 2013 through Government Reorganization Plan No. 2. GovOps oversees the infrastructure of state government operations, ensuring effective management of the state's workforce, technology, procurement, and administrative services.

### GovOps Mission and Responsibilities

**Mission:** Improve the management and accountability of state government programs, increase efficiency, promote coordinated operational decisions, and streamline services to Californians.

**Core Functions:**
- Workforce management and human resources policy (CalHR)
- Information technology infrastructure and cybersecurity (CDT)
- Procurement and real estate management (DGS)
- Innovation and data-driven service delivery (ODI)
- Tax administration (Franchise Tax Board)
- Administrative law and regulatory oversight (OAL)

**Current Scope:**
GovOps directly oversees 13 departments, boards, and offices, with primary jurisdiction within these entities. The agency serves in a coordinating and advisory capacity for broader state government but lacks direct authority to mandate changes across other cabinet agencies.

### How E3 Expands GovOps Coordination Capability

This Enterprise Modernization Plan establishes a framework that enables GovOps to coordinate statewide efficiency and effectiveness initiatives while respecting the autonomy of other cabinet agencies. The E3 model creates this capability through:

**Transformation Management Office (TMO) within GovOps:**
- Housed within GovOps, the TMO provides centralized coordination, portfolio management, and performance tracking for all E3 initiatives statewide
- TMO supports (but does not control) E3 Undersecretaries across all agencies
- Provides services: knowledge management, performance analytics, change management support, innovation coordination
- Creates visibility and accountability without exercising direct authority over other agencies

**Statewide E3 Council:**
- Convened through Governor's Office with TMO providing staff support
- Brings together E3 Undersecretaries from all agencies for coordination and alignment
- GovOps Secretary participates but does not direct other agency E3 leaders
- Creates peer network enabling voluntary collaboration and best practice sharing

**Partnership with Independent Data Governance Office:**
- Independent Office (outside any single agency) sets binding statewide data standards
- GovOps entities (CDT, ODI) serve as technical implementation partners
- E3 leaders across all agencies must comply with Independent Office standards
- This structure provides authority that GovOps alone cannot exercise

**Leveraging GovOps Expertise:**
- CDT provides technology standards, cybersecurity guidance, and infrastructure services to all E3 initiatives
- ODI provides innovation methods, human-centered design, and training through CalAcademy to all agencies
- CalHR provides workforce planning and classification support for data governance teams statewide
- DGS supports procurement innovation and facilities management

The E3 structure transforms GovOps from an agency with limited direct authority into the **coordination hub** for statewide modernization, providing infrastructure, expertise, and support that enables E3 leaders across all agencies to succeed. This respects California's decentralized governance while creating the coordination necessary for enterprise transformation.

## The Role of the Office of Data and Innovation

The **Office of Data and Innovation (ODI)**, established on July 1, 2019 within the Government Operations Agency and elevated to a standalone department on July 1, 2023, has pioneered innovative approaches to government service delivery through data, human-centered design, and technology. ODI's mission is to drive innovation across California state government to achieve exceptional, equitable outcomes for all Californians.

### ODI's Critical Role in This Plan

**Current ODI Functions:**
- Data and Innovation Fund (DIF) supporting department-level transformation projects
- CalAcademy providing training in human-centered design, data, and innovation practices
- CalInnovate advancing service design and user research
- Statewide Chief Data Officer leading data governance initiatives
- CalData managing California's open data portal

**How This Plan Amplifies ODI's Impact:**

The E3 model creates empowered champions at every agency who can mandate adoption of ODI-developed tools, practices, and standards. ODI transitions from an optional service provider to an essential enabler of statewide modernization. The plan positions ODI to:

- **Scale proven approaches statewide** through E3 Undersecretaries and Chief Deputy Directors with authority to implement ODI recommendations across their agencies
- **Coordinate the Governor's Innovation Fellowship Program** providing continuous talent pipeline that embeds ODI methods throughout state government
- **Support the Transformation Management Office** with performance analytics, knowledge management, and change management expertise
- **Partner with the Independent Data Governance Office** as the technical implementation arm for statewide data standards and sharing frameworks
- **Leverage the Breakthrough Modernization Fund** to accelerate high-impact DIF projects and create replicable models

---

## Talent Pipeline and Sustainability

### Governor's Innovation Fellowship

A continuous talent pipeline feeds the E3 structure:

- **6-month cohorts** of 20 fellows, with new cohorts starting every 4 months (2-month overlap between cohorts)
- **Department embedding** for hands-on experience outside home agencies
- **Group initiatives** organized as 4 teams of 5 fellows delivering cross-agency modernization solutions
- **Post-fellowship engagement** as on-call subject matter experts and emergency response capacity
- **Preferential hiring** into E3 and other executive positions, with fellowship completion as desirable qualification in duty statements
- **Host department surrogates** ensuring business continuity and sustainable succession planning

**Production Capacity:**
- 3 cohorts launched per year = **60 fellows annually**
- By end of Year 2: 6 cohorts graduated = **120 trained modernization leaders**
- Continuous pipeline providing sustained change agent supply statewide

### Data Governance Teams

Permanent state staff teams providing sustainable capacity:

- **Leadership by domain experts** utilizing Supervising Engineer, Supervising Geologist, Environmental Program Manager, or equivalent classifications capable of managing Senior-level technical specialists
- **Blended expertise model** integrating licensed professionals (Engineers, Geologists, Environmental Scientists) with dedicated data professionals (Research Data Specialists at senior/supervisory levels)
- **Science classifications in leadership** provide higher compensation, strong critical thinking skills, and data expertise requisite to scientific practice
- **Professional accountability** through supervisory classification standards and professional licensure where applicable
- **Scalable structure** adaptable to any department using equivalent classification series

These teams support Fellows' projects and sustain innovations after Fellows complete their assignments.

---

## Breakthrough Funding Model

The **California Breakthrough Modernization Fund** creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop where efficiency gains generate ongoing modernization capacity.

**Seed Investment:**
- 50/50 partnership between State of California and private sector partners
- Combined initial fund: $100 million total ($50M state, $50M private)
- State separately funds all permanent positions through ongoing General Fund contributions
- Creates "Innovation Sidecar Fund" co-investing with state dollars

**Transparency and Public Benefit:**

Clear accountability mechanisms ensure both Californians and investors understand benefits:
- **Public reporting:** Quarterly public dashboards showing all funded projects, status, and outcomes
- **Benefit tracking:** Documented cost savings returned to General Fund, service improvements, and digital adoption metrics
- **Private sector benefit:** Access to common technical and architectural patterns enabling their solutions to better integrate with government systems and meet unique governmental needs, creating replicable approaches applicable to other states and jurisdictions
- **Legislative oversight:** Annual comprehensive reports to Legislature with detailed portfolio performance

**Feedback Loop:**
- Projects demonstrate efficiency gains and cost savings
- Department baseline budgets reduced to reflect realized efficiencies
- **Fixed 25%** of released funding diverted into Breakthrough Fund
- Remainder (75%) returns to General Fund, providing both fiscal benefit and replenished modernization pool

**Portfolio Reporting:**
- ODI manages fund using private-sector portfolio approach
- Annual "Modernization Portfolio Report" showing deployed capital, realized savings, key wins, and reusable components
- Breakthrough partners receive granular dashboards emphasizing co-learning and replication, not governance control

This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where each successful modernization generates capacity for the next.

## Readiness Assessment Framework

The **Readiness Assessment** is a comprehensive evaluation tool that determines department preparedness for E3 deployment and modernization investments. This framework provides structured analysis across six critical domains:

**Assessment Domains:**
1. **Leadership and Governance** (25% weight) - Executive sponsorship, strategic alignment, governance maturity
2. **Data and Technology Infrastructure** (25% weight) - Cloud adoption, API maturity, data governance
3. **Organizational Culture and Workforce** (20% weight) - Change readiness, digital literacy, modern talent
4. **Cybersecurity and Risk** (15% weight) - Policy compliance, security governance
5. **Service Delivery** (10% weight) - Digital service maturity, user-centered design
6. **Funding and Portfolio Management** (5% weight) - Project management maturity, investment readiness

**Readiness Tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (Score 4.0-5.0):** Ready for immediate E3 deployment and modernization funding
- **Tier 2 (Score 3.0-3.9):** Ready with targeted support; specific capability gaps addressed
- **Tier 3 (Score 2.0-2.9):** Requires 6-12 month capacity building before E3 deployment
- **Tier 4 (Score < 2.0):** Fundamental organizational development required

**How Readiness Assessment Drives Implementation:**

The assessment informs every phase of the modernization plan:

- **E3 Deployment Prioritization:** Tier 1 departments receive Chief Deputy Directors first, creating early wins and demonstrating value
- **Fellowship Placements:** Fellows embedded in Tier 1-2 departments where they can succeed; Tier 3-4 departments receive capacity-building support first
- **Breakthrough Fund Allocation:** Projects from Tier 1 departments prioritized for funding; Tier 2-3 departments receive conditional funding with capability-building requirements
- **Data Governance Team Deployment:** Pilot teams deployed to Tier 1 departments to establish models; lessons learned inform Tier 2-3 deployments
- **Training Investments:** Tier 3-4 departments receive intensive CalAcademy training and change management support before E3 deployment
- **Risk Mitigation:** Low-readiness departments identified early, avoiding project failures and enabling targeted interventions

Departments re-assess **annually** using the framework, tracking progress and demonstrating improvement over time. This creates accountability, transparency, and a data-driven approach to resource allocation.

## Critical Success Factors

**Executive Commitment**
Sustained engagement from Governor and Agency Secretaries for 5+ years. Government transformation requires 7-10 years on average; early leadership departure derails momentum.

**Actual Authority**
E3 leaders must have real decision-making power over technology investments, data sharing mandates, and performance accountability—not merely advisory roles. The Independent Office model provides this authority.

**GovOps Coordination Infrastructure**
TMO within GovOps must have adequate staffing, authority, and resources to coordinate statewide efforts effectively without micromanaging agency E3 leaders.

**Readiness-Based Deployment**
Use the Readiness Assessment framework to sequence E3 deployment, ensuring early successes build momentum rather than early failures creating resistance.

**Quick Wins**
Deliver 5-10 visible improvements within Year 1 to build credibility, demonstrate capability, and overcome skepticism.

**Measurement Discipline**
Transparent reporting of progress and setbacks. Publish metrics even when unfavorable. What gets measured gets managed.

**Talent Development**
The Fellowship creates a pipeline, but sustained capability requires workforce investment at scale through data governance teams and ongoing training.

**ODI Integration**
Leverage ODI's proven approaches, tools, and expertise by ensuring E3 leaders actively partner with ODI and mandate adoption of ODI-developed standards and practices.

## California as National Model

This Enterprise Modernization Plan positions California as the definitive government modernization model for other U.S. states. By documenting the E3 Operational Model, Independent Data Governance Office, Fellowship program, Breakthrough funding model, and implementation playbooks, California enables peer states to adopt proven approaches.

**Open Access to California's Innovation:**

All documentation, development patterns, planning documents, technical specifications, and implementation guides developed through this initiative will be made publicly available online for other states and jurisdictions to use if desired. This includes:

- **Strategic Planning Templates:** E3 governance charters, readiness assessment tools, implementation roadmaps
- **Technical Patterns:** API standards, service mesh architectures, agentic system design patterns, data sharing agreement templates
- **Training Materials:** Fellowship program curriculum, CalAcademy course content adapted for government modernization
- **Performance Frameworks:** KPI definitions, dashboard specifications, evaluation methodologies
- **Procurement Tools:** RFI² solicitation templates, modular contracting guides, vendor evaluation criteria
- **Code and Platforms:** Open-source tools, reusable components, integration frameworks

California will establish a dedicated public repository and documentation portal, enabling other states to adopt, adapt, and improve upon these approaches. This commitment to open government innovation accelerates modernization nationally while positioning California as the thought leader in 21st-century public sector transformation.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Forcing Mechanism:** E3 model creates efficiency driver government inherently lacks
- **Actual Authority:** Independent Office provides cross-branch legitimacy and enforceable power
- **GovOps Coordination:** Centralized support without centralized control, respecting agency autonomy
- **Talent Pipeline:** Continuous Fellowship cohorts (60 annually) provide sustained change agent supply
- **Sustainable Funding:** Breakthrough model converts efficiency gains into ongoing modernization capacity
- **Product-Led Delivery:** Service mesh architecture and modular contracting break traditional project cycles
- **Evidence-Based:** Comprehensive Readiness Assessment and performance frameworks enable rigorous evaluation
- **ODI Integration:** Proven innovation approaches scaled statewide through E3 structure
- **Open Innovation:** All materials publicly available for peer state adoption

California's scale (40 million residents, $400B+ budget, 170 departments, 230,000+ employees) demonstrates applicability to states of all sizes.

## Conclusion

California's government modernization challenge is fundamentally an organizational design problem, not merely a technology problem. The E3 Operational Model creates the forcing mechanism for efficiency that government inherently lacks, ensuring sustained focus on effectiveness and continuous improvement.

By establishing the Independent Office of State Data Governance with actual cross-branch authority, positioning GovOps as the coordination hub through the Transformation Management Office, launching the Governor's Innovation Fellowship as a continuous talent pipeline (60 fellows annually), deploying professional data governance teams for sustainable capacity, creating the Breakthrough Modernization Fund for catalytic investment and reinvestment, and leveraging ODI's proven innovation approaches through empowered E3 champions, California establishes a comprehensive, replicable approach to government transformation.

The Readiness Assessment framework ensures strategic, risk-mitigated deployment that builds momentum through early wins rather than undermining credibility through premature failures. The commitment to open innovation—making all documentation and development patterns publicly available—positions California not just as a successful modernizer, but as a national leader enabling peer states to accelerate their own transformations.

Success requires executive commitment, actual authority structures, effective GovOps coordination, readiness-based deployment, measurement discipline, and integration of ODI's innovation expertise. This plan provides the roadmap; execution determines whether California realizes its potential as the national model for 21st-century government effectiveness.

**The question is not whether California can afford to modernize—it's whether California can afford not to.**
