## 5. Technology Architecture

### 5.1 Service Mesh Architecture

Service mesh enables interoperability through APIs rather than monolithic databases.

### 5.2 Legacy System Modernization

Strangler pattern for incremental modernization with Readiness-based prioritization.

### 5.3 Cloud Strategy (Streamlined)

Hybrid cloud approach: cloud-first for new development, strategic on-premises retention, multi-cloud flexibility via CDT.

### 5.4 Cybersecurity

Zero trust architecture with NIST/SIMM compliance.

### 5.5 Staff Empowerment for Agentic Data Systems ⭐ NEW

**Vision:** Enable staff to create AI-powered data workflows using state-approved patterns and shared infrastructure.

**State-Approved Design Patterns:**
- Data analysis and visualization
- Document processing and extraction 
- Workflow automation and case management
- Knowledge base and expert systems

**Standards:** Content classification, accuracy requirements, bias testing, transparency, logging, version control.

**Shared Infrastructure:** CDT-operated enterprise AI platform, departmental sandboxes, template library.

**Deployment:** Sandbox → testing → security scan → peer review → pilot → production in days/weeks.

## 6. Procurement Innovation

**Philosophy:** Cheap, scalable, self-supportable solutions over monolithic enterprise systems.

### 6.1 Modular Contracting ($10M Cap)

Decompose large projects into independent $10M modules reducing risk and enabling competition.

### 6.2 RFI² Process

Problem-centric procurement soliciting innovative solutions rather than prescribing technology.

### 6.3 Pre-Qualified Vendor Pools + Small Business Equity ⭐

**Tiered Structure:**
- Tier 1: Small businesses, DVBEs (<100 employees, <$20M revenue)
- Tier 2: Medium (100-500 employees)
- Tier 3: Large (500+ employees)

**Set-Asides:** 
- <$1M: Tier 1 first
- $1M-$5M: Tier 1 subcontractor requirements
- Goal: 25% spend to Tier 1 by Year 3

## 7. Talent Development

### 7.1 Fellowship: 60 Fellows/Year ⭐

- 6-month cohorts, 20 fellows each
- New cohort every 4 months (2-month overlap)
- 3 cohorts/year = 60 fellows annually
- 4 teams of 5 fellows
- Host department surrogates for continuity

### 7.2 Post-Fellowship

Alumni network, career pathways to E3/data teams/ODI/TMO.

### 7.3 Executive Duty Statements

Fellowship completion = desirable qualification for E3 positions.

### 7.4 Data Governance Teams: Science Classifications ⭐

**Leadership:** Supervising Engineer/Geologist/Environmental Program Manager ($9.5K-$12K/month)

**Why Science:** Higher pay, critical thinking, data expertise, professional licensure.

**Team:** Director + 2-3 Senior specialists + Data Ops Lead + 2-4 Data Specialists (6-9 total)
