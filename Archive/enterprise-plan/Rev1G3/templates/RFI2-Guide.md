# RFI² Implementation Guide

**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide for agencies issuing Request for Innovative Ideas (RFI²) solicitations, with templates and checklists.

---

### **3.1 When to Use RFI²**

**Ideal Use Cases:**
✓ Complex technical challenges without obvious solutions  
✓ Emerging technology applications (AI, blockchain, quantum, etc.)  
✓ Cross-cutting problems affecting multiple agencies  
✓ Market innovation needed (better results than current capabilities)  
✓ High uncertainty requiring experimentation before full commitment

**Not Appropriate For:**
✗ Commodity purchases (standard hardware/software)  
✗ Well-defined requirements with known solutions  
✗ Urgent procurements (RFI² takes 9-12 months total)  
✗ Low-dollar, low-complexity needs  
✗ Situations where agency has already decided on approach

**Budget Allocation:**
Reserve 15-25% of technology modernization budget for RFI² projects focusing on highest-impact, highest-uncertainty challenges.

### **3.2 Phase 1: Innovation Concept Papers**

**Step 1: Problem Statement Development (Weeks 1-4)**

**Internal Workshop:**

- Assemble team: Agency subject matter experts, frontline staff who experience problem, technical leads, California Breakthrough Project advisor (if applicable)
- Duration: 2-3 half-day sessions
- Outputs: Problem definition, desired outcomes, constraints, evaluation criteria

**Problem Statement Template:**

---

**[Agency Name] Request for Innovative Ideas**  
**RFI² Number:** [Unique ID]  
**Publication Date:** [Date]

**Problem Title:** [Concise description, e.g., "Predictive Maintenance for State Infrastructure"]

**1. Background and Context**

[2-3 paragraphs explaining the problem, why it matters, and current state]

Example:
"California maintains 50,000+ miles of highways, 13,000 bridges, and thousands of state buildings. Current maintenance approaches are reactive—we fix things when they break. This leads to emergency repairs costing 3-5× planned maintenance, service disruptions affecting millions of citizens, and safety risks. Annual maintenance budget exceeds $2B, yet deferred maintenance backlog grows yearly. We seek innovative approaches to predicting when infrastructure will fail, enabling proactive maintenance, reducing costs, and improving safety."

**2. Desired Outcomes**

[Specific, measurable outcomes—what would success look like?]

Example:

- Reduce emergency repairs by 50% through predictive identification of failures
- Decrease maintenance cost per mile/structure by 30%
- Improve infrastructure availability (reduce closures/downtime) by 40%
- Extend average infrastructure lifespan by 20%

**3. Constraints and Requirements**

[Parameters vendors must work within]

Example:

- **Budget Range:** Proof of Concept $50K-$100K per vendor; full implementation $5M-$10M
- **Timeline:** 90-day PoC, 18-month implementation
- **Compliance:** All data must remain in California or approved jurisdictions; NIST security standards; accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Integration:** Must integrate with existing asset management systems (specify platforms)

**4. Evaluation Criteria**

[How concepts will be assessed—be transparent]

Example:

- **Innovation Potential (40%):** How novel is the approach? Does it represent significant improvement over current state?
- **Feasibility (30%):** Is it technically viable? Can it be implemented at California's scale? Any proof of concept or pilots elsewhere?
- **Cost-Effectiveness (20%):** What's the ROI? Total cost of ownership?
- **Vendor Qualifications (10%):** Does team have relevant experience and capability?

**5. Concept Paper Requirements**

[What vendors must submit]

- **Executive Summary:** 1 page high-level overview
- **Technical Approach:** 3-5 pages describing solution (how it works, technologies used, why it's innovative)
- **Feasibility Evidence:** Prior implementations, research, prototypes, pilot results
- **Team Qualifications:** Relevant experience, key personnel bios, partnerships
- **Cost Estimate:** ROM for PoC and full implementation
- **Implementation Timeline:** High-level milestones
- **Length:** 10-15 pages (excluding team bios and appendices)

**6. Submission Instructions**

- **Deadline:** [Date and time]
- **Format:** PDF submitted via [procurement portal or email]
- **Questions:** Submit questions to [contact] by [date]; answers published publicly
- **Selection Timeline:** Evaluation complete by [date], vendors notified by [date]
- **Phase 2 Details:** Selected vendors (anticipated 2-5) will receive $[X] contracts to develop Proof of Concept over 90 days

**7. Additional Information**

- Link to Innovation Conference details (see Step 2)
- Contact information for questions
- Legal terms and conditions
- Non-binding nature of concept papers (state not obligated to proceed)

**Step 2: Innovation Conference (Week 5)**

**Purpose:** Educate market, generate excitement, enable collaboration, clarify expectations

**Planning Checklist:**

Pre-Conference (4 weeks before):

- [ ] Reserve venue (capacity 100-200) or plan virtual event
- [ ] Announce conference date/details in RFI² publication
- [ ] Invite vendors (procurement portal, industry newsletters, targeted outreach)
- [ ] Prepare presentations (problem deep-dive, Q&A with agency experts)
- [ ] Invite California Breakthrough Project advisors as speakers
- [ ] Create breakout session structure

Conference Day:

- [ ] Registration and networking (30 min)
- [ ] Welcome and overview (15 min) - Agency leadership explains strategic importance
- [ ] Problem statement presentation (45 min) - Deep dive by subject matter experts
- [ ] Q&A with government stakeholders (45 min)
- [ ] Break and networking (30 min)
- [ ] Breakout sessions by solution approach (60 min) - Vendors discuss ideas, form teams
- [ ] Closing remarks (15 min) - Recap timeline, expectations, Q&A

Post-Conference:

- [ ] Publish presentation materials and FAQ online
- [ ] Share attendee list (with permission) enabling networking
- [ ] Send follow-up email with submission reminders

**Step 3: Concept Paper Evaluation (Weeks 16-20)**

### **3.3 Phase 2: Proof of Concept Development**

**Step 5: PoC Planning (Weeks 22-26)**

**Kickoff Meetings with Each Vendor:**

Agenda:

- Refine scope based on concept paper feedback
- Define specific success criteria (quantitative metrics)
- Identify data needed from agency (plan for sanitization/anonymization)
- Determine environment (vendor cloud, state cloud, hybrid)
- Establish check-in cadence (biweekly recommended)
- Clarify evaluation process and timeline

**PoC Plan Template:**

---

**Proof of Concept Plan**

**Vendor:** [Name]  
**Agency:** [Name]  
**RFI² Title:** [Problem statement]  
**PoC Timeline:** [Start date] - [End date]

**1. Scope**

[What specific capabilities will be demonstrated in PoC]

Example: "Demonstrate predictive model for bridge maintenance by analyzing 5 years of inspection data for 100 sample bridges, predicting which bridges will require maintenance in next 12 months, and comparing predictions to actual maintenance needs."

**2. Success Criteria**

[Quantitative metrics defining success]

Example:

- Prediction accuracy ≥75% (correctly identify bridges needing maintenance)
- False positive rate ≤20% (don't over-predict)
- Demonstration of cost savings (estimate $ saved by proactive vs. reactive maintenance)
- Usability: Agency staff can operate system with <4 hours training

**3. Data Requirements**

[What data is needed from agency]

Example:

- 5 years bridge inspection reports (PDF and structured data if available)
- Maintenance logs (work orders, costs, dates)
- Bridge inventory (age, materials, traffic volume, location)
- **Agency Responsibilities:** Sanitize data (remove PII, sensitive locations), provide by [date]
- **Vendor Responsibilities:** Secure data handling (encryption, access controls), return or destroy data at PoC end
