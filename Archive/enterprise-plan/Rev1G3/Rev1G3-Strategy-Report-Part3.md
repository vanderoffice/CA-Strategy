## Section 7: Performance Measurement

### 7.1 New KPIs for a Product-Led Government

We are moving beyond "uptime" and "project completion" to measure **value delivery**.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

1.  **Time to Value (TTV):**

    - _Definition:_ The time from a policy decision to the first release of working software to citizens.
    - _Target:_ < 3 months for initial MVP.

2.  **Deployment Frequency:**

    - _Definition:_ How often are we shipping improvements?
    - _Target:_ At least bi-weekly for active products.

3.  **Life Event Success Rate:**

    - _Definition:_ Percentage of users who complete a cross-agency journey (e.g., "Start a Business") without human intervention.
    - _Target:_ > 80%.

4.  **Modular Health:**
    - _Definition:_ Percentage of IT contracts under $10M cap.
    - _Target:_ 100% by Year 2 (waivers required for exceptions).

## Section 8: Financial Strategy

### 8.1 The "Technology Working Capital Fund"

The annual "Use It or Lose It" budget cycle is the enemy of modern software. We are establishing a **Revolving Fund** to break this cycle.

**Mechanism:**

1.  **Seed Capital:** Legislature appropriates a one-time seed fund (e.g., $250M).
2.  **Borrowing:** Agencies "borrow" from the fund for modernization efforts that have a clear ROI (e.g., decommissioning a mainframe saves $5M/year).
3.  **Repayment:** Agencies repay the fund over 5 years from the operational savings generated by the modernization.
4.  **Reinvestment:** Repayments replenish the fund, allowing it to finance new projects indefinitely.

**Benefit:** This creates a self-sustaining engine for modernization that doesn't require fighting for new appropriations every year.
