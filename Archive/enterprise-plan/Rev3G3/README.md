## Key Themes Introduced

### Three Strategic Pillars
1. **The Engine:** E3 Operational Model with Undersecretary and Chief Deputy Director positions
2. **The Method:** Product-Led Government with Life Experience Teams
3. **The Catalyst:** Statewide Data Governance as the "wedge" to launch the structure

### "Forcing Mechanism" Concept
This version emphasized that government lacks a natural forcing mechanism for efficiency (unlike the private sector's profit motive), and the E3 model creates this through institutional design.

### Option A Recommendation
Recommended pursuing Statutory Interagency Governance (Option A) through the California Interagency Data Council (CIDC) as the launchpad for the broader strategy.
