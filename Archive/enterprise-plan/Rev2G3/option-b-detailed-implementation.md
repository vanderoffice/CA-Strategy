# Option B: Independent Office of State Data Governance

## Deep Dive Implementation Plan

### Overview

Option B creates a new, statutorily independent entity for statewide data governance, wholly separate from GovOps and not under the direct authority of the Governor or any single branch. The model is similar to California’s Little Hoover Commission or Bureau of State Audits, offering cross-branch legitimacy and durability but requiring significant up-front coordination.

Given that Governor Newsom’s term ends in early January 2027, the timeline is tight, but prudent groundwork and statutory design could allow launch before transition to the next governor, with initial structures and Board appointments in place.

## Governance Structure

### Independent State Office of Data Governance

**Board Composition:**

- **Appointed seats:**
  - Governor (2 members, including the Chair or Vice Chair)
  - Senate Rules Committee (1 member)
  - Assembly Speaker (1 member)
  - Judicial Council (1 member)
  - UC Regents or representative (1 member, for higher education)
  - CSU Board or representative (1 member, for higher education)
  - Rotation/appointment from among constitutional officers (e.g., Attorney General or designee, Treasurer, Controller, Superintendent of Public Instruction)
  - Optionally, public member(s) with statewide data leadership experience

- **Term Length:** Staggered 3-year terms to avoid full turnover at administration change
- **Quorum Requirements** to ensure cross-branch engagement at all meetings

**Board Authority:**

- Appoints an Executive Director (State Chief Data Officer) through independent, merit-based search and Senate confirmation
- Approves statewide data standards, privacy and security protocols, and sectoral governance models
- Oversees budget, strategic plan, and performance metrics

---

## Statutory Requirements

**Foundational Legislation:**
- Passed as a standalone bill (e.g., California Statewide Data Governance Act)
- Defines board composition, mandate, and authorities
- Creates independent budget line-item for Office operations
- Places State CDO reporting jointly to the Board, not the Governor or another cabinet officer

**Authority Scope:**
- Mandate to set statewide standards for data management, sharing, privacy, and security
- Authority to convene representatives of all branches for policy development
- Ability to enter into MOUs, data sharing agreements, and to be a signatory on major statewide initiatives (e.g., Cradle-to-Career, climate data efforts)
- Publish annual or biennial reports on progress, compliance, and outcomes

---

## Office Functions and Staffing

**Core Staff:**
- Executive Director/Chief Data Officer (Senate-confirmed)
- Deputy Director for Policy and Governance
- Legal counsel (privacy, confidentiality, and intergovernmental issues)
- Standards, Data Quality, and Metadata Manager(s)
- Sectoral Coordinators (project-specific, e.g. justice, health, economic development)
- Administrative and IT operations

**Budget Estimate:**
- Initial launch: $3M–$5M one-time setup (staffing, facilities, IT)
- Annual operating: $2.5M–$4M (personnel, convenings, technology, reporting)

**Role Relative to ODI:**
- ODI continues to operate within GovOps, focusing on executive-branch implementation, user-centered design, and innovation pilots
- The Office collaborates with ODI as a technical provider or implementation partner for executive projects
- No direct authority over ODI; all alignment is via Board-approved policies and formal MOUs

## Implementation Timeline (Nov 2025–Jan 2027)

### Phase 1: Stakeholder Alignment and Bill Preparation (Nov 2025–Feb 2026)

1. **Form intra-branch working group** (Governor’s Office, Leg Counsel, Judicial Council staff, key constitutional offices)
2. **Draft foundational statute**, including Board composition, powers, funding strategy, reporting timelines
3. **Advance sponsor and legislative champions** for bill introduction (target: February 2026)
4. **Preliminary Board candidate identification** and vetting

### Phase 2: Legislative Process and Board Launch (Mar 2026–Jun 2026)

1. **Bill introduction and committee process**
2. **Targeted stakeholder and public engagement** (legislative committees, judiciary, constitutional officers, higher education, public interest groups)
3. **Rapid amendment process** to address legal and cross-branch concerns
4. **Passage and signing, with funding included in the 2026–2027 budget**

### Phase 3: Board Appointments and Office Setup (Jul 2026–Oct 2026)

1. **Governor, legislative leaders, constitutional officers, and others make appointments** (July–August 2026)
2. **Convene first Board meeting** (target: late August/early September 2026)
3. **Board appoints Executive Director/Chief Data Officer**, launches hiring for core staff
4. **Secure office location, IT infrastructure, basic administrative capabilities**

### Phase 4: Policy Launch and Early Deliverables (Nov 2026–Jan 2027)

1. **Board reviews and adopts initial statewide data standards and priorities**
2. **Negotiate MOUs with ODI and existing data collaboratives**
3. **Commission initial projects in 1–2 high-need sectors (e.g., justice, health, climate)**
4. **Public reporting on launch status and near-term roadmap**

### Transition to Next Administration (Dec 2026–Jan 2027)

- **Deliver transition memo** to incoming Governor with status report, Board priorities, and recommendations
- **Ensure all staff, contracts, and ongoing partnerships are stable for continuity**

## Key Benefits

- Establishes visible, neutral body for statewide data coordination, with members from all branches
- Embeds stability—reduces abrupt changes with each new administration
- Signals commitment to data-driven decision-making at the highest levels
- Allows deep, cross-agency governance frameworks not dependent on executive branch authority alone

---

## Principal Risks and Mitigation

**Short Timeline:** Board appointments, legal wrangling, and start-up logistics are challenging in a compressed timeframe; mitigated by early stakeholder engagement and possibly empowering an interim steering committee to jumpstart early deliverables.

**Political Resistance:** Any perception of bureaucracy or dilution of executive power could slow bill passage; engage legislative, judicial, and constitutional office leadership early and often.

**Overlap with ODI:** Clearly document office purpose and relationship to ODI in statute and public communications; ensure ODI is a partner in project implementation, not a competitor.

**Sustained Support:** The office’s longevity depends on continued board appointments and budget; sunset clauses or performance triggers can help ensure focus and accountability.

## Success Metrics by January 2027

- Board fully appointed and operational, with quarterly meetings held
- Executive Director/Chief Data Officer and core staff hired
- Statewide data standards published in at least one sector
- MOUs in place with executive agencies, ODI, and at least 2–3 major non-executive partners
- Advisory input and positive feedback from cross-branch participants
- Public communication of progress, building credibility for the new administration

## Conclusion

While more ambitious and resource-intensive than Option A, the independent office model establishes a stable, cross-branch governance platform for California, creating institutional momentum for future administrations. Early legislative action and determined project management can ensure launch by early 2027 and deliver an enduring framework for statewide data leadership.
