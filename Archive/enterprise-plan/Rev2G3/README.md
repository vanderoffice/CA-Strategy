# Rev2G3: Statewide Data Governance

This folder focuses on the critical challenge of fragmented data governance across California's state government. While previous revisions focused on delivery and operations, **Rev2G3** addresses the foundational issue that major policy decisions often proceed without coordinated data practices, definitions, or shared infrastructure.

## Core Concept: Two Strategic Options

This revision presents two distinct paths for the Governor to establish meaningful statewide data governance within the remaining term:

### Option A: Statutory Interagency Governance + Executive Actions

- **Approach:** Strengthen and extend existing structures (Office of Data and Innovation, GovOps) through statute and formal agreements.
- **Pros:** Highly feasible within 13 months, leverages existing momentum, respects constitutional autonomy.
- **Cons:** Limited enforceability for non-executive entities (Judicial, Legislative, Constitutional Officers).

### Option B: Independent Office of State Data Governance

- **Approach:** Create a new, statutorily independent entity with a multi-branch board of directors.
- **Pros:** Perceived neutrality, stronger long-term sustainability, better buy-in from non-executive branches.
- **Cons:** Harder to stand up quickly, potential for bureaucratic overhead.

## Key Documents

- **`data-governance-main-brief.md`**: The primary memorandum comparing the two options and recommending Option A as the primary path with Option B as a contingency.
- **`option-a-detailed-implementation.md`**: A deep dive into the implementation of the Interagency Governance model (Timeline, Structure, Legal Requirements).
- **`option-b-detailed-implementation.md`**: A deep dive into the implementation of the Independent Office model (Board Composition, Authority, Transition Plan).

## Recommendation

The strategy recommends pursuing **Option A** as the primary path because it delivers concrete results (standards, shared platforms) within the remaining term, while laying the groundwork that could evolve into Option B if necessary.
