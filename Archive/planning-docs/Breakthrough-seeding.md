# Create a plan concept where, as the Office of Data and Innovation and the Governor's Innovation Fellowship begins to modernize different state departments, when those state departments no longer need the general funding because they're now more efficient, one quarter or some portion of that funding that's returned back to the general fund is diverted into a future technology modernization fund so that as we modernize, we can keep the modernizations going. This should perform or act like a feedback loop.

Create a dedicated “Future Technology Modernization Fund” that automatically receives a defined share of verified savings from ODI- and Governor’s Innovation Fellows–led projects once departments reduce or release baseline General Fund or special fund support due to efficiency gains. This makes each modernization project both an operational improvement and a capital generator for the next wave of modernization, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop similar to existing government revolving funds and technology modernization funds.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3][^1_4][^1_5][^1_6]

## Core fund concept

- Establish the Future Technology Modernization Fund (FTMF) in statute as a special fund or revolving fund dedicated to digital, data, and service-delivery modernization across state government.[^1_2][^1_5]
- Define the funding source as a fixed portion (for example 25–40 percent) of ongoing General Fund or special fund appropriations that departments formally and permanently relinquish as a result of ODI/Governor’s Innovation Fellows projects that increase efficiency or reduce cost.[^1_4][^1_1]
- Allow the FTMF to make multi-year investments in modernization projects with clear ROI, including service design, data infrastructure, and legacy system replacement, modeled on structures like the federal Technology Modernization Fund and California’s existing Data and Innovation Services Revolving Fund.[^1_7][^1_5][^1_2]


## Feedback loop mechanism

- Phase 1 – Investment: FTMF makes an initial investment in a department project sponsored by ODI or the Fellows, with a business case that quantifies expected baseline funding reductions or cost avoidance over a 3–5 year horizon.[^1_3][^1_1][^1_4]
- Phase 2 – Efficiency and release: After implementation and verification (through DOF/CDT/ODI review), the department’s base budget is reduced or restructured to reflect realized efficiencies, and those dollars are returned to the General Fund or relevant fund.[^1_8][^1_2]
- Phase 3 – Diversion and reinvestment: Statute or budget control language diverts a set fraction of that released amount (for example one quarter) into the FTMF, while the remainder stays in the General Fund, giving both statewide fiscal benefit and a replenished pool for further modernization projects.[^1_5][^1_6][^1_2]


## Governance and accountability

- Create an FTMF governing board or steering committee aligned with existing structures (for example ODI Director, CDT CIO, DOF, GovOps, and external public members) to select projects, similar to selection processes used for the Data and Innovation Fund and federal TMF.[^1_6][^1_1][^1_3][^1_5]
- Require each funded project to submit: 1) clear problem statements and user outcomes; 2) projected fiscal and service-delivery benefits; and 3) a repayment/savings capture plan that specifies how much ongoing appropriation will be released and on what timeline.[^1_9][^1_1][^1_3][^1_7]
- Mandate annual public reporting that aggregates total savings generated, amounts diverted back to the General Fund, and FTMF reinvestments, tying results to statewide data and digital strategy documents already produced by ODI.[^1_10][^1_11][^1_3]


## Role of ODI and Innovation Fellows

- Use ODI’s Data and Innovation Fund and service portfolio as the primary pipeline for FTMF-eligible projects, emphasizing human-centered design, data-informed decision-making, and modular technical approaches that can be reused across departments.[^1_12][^1_1][^1_3][^1_9]
- Position the Governor’s Innovation Fellows as a “delivery engine” that scopes, delivers, and measures efficiency projects, explicitly linking their six‑month engagements to quantifiable budget impacts that feed the FTMF.[^1_13][^1_14][^1_4]
- Integrate FTMF metrics into Fellows and ODI project charters (for example “projected annual savings,” “percentage of savings diverted to FTMF,” “reusable components created”), reinforcing the expectation that every modernization creates capacity for the next.[^1_1][^1_3][^1_4]


## Legislative and budget design choices

- Enact enabling legislation that: 1) creates the FTMF; 2) defines eligible uses; 3) sets the default diversion rate of verified savings; and 4) allows DOF to adjust or waive the rate in cases where departments face critical service pressures.[^1_2][^1_8]
- Align FTMF with existing state and federal financing models, borrowing design elements from revolving loan funds and state infrastructure banks (for example performance-based disbursements, partial repayment from savings, and multi-year investment authority).[^1_15][^1_5][^1_2]
- Start with a one-time seed capitalization (for example a limited-term General Fund appropriation or redirection from existing innovation funds) and a small number of high-visibility projects to demonstrate the feedback loop before scaling.[^1_16][^1_5][^1_2]

# Include the Breakthrough partners as the seed investors and have ODI report back in a similar model as private sector investment.

Design the Future Technology Modernization Fund so that Breakthrough partners act as early “seed investors,” with ODI reporting results using an investment-style model familiar to private sector funders. This keeps the feedback loop you described but layers in catalytic outside capital and a more rigorous, portfolio-style performance narrative.[^2_1][^2_2][^2_3][^2_4]

## Seed role for Breakthrough partners

- Position the California Breakthrough Project’s private-sector participants and philanthropic partners as initial capital providers alongside a one-time state appropriation, similar to other blended public–philanthropic models California has used.[^2_2][^2_3][^2_4][^2_1]
- Structure their contributions as: 1) philanthropic grants into a companion “Innovation Sidecar Fund” that co-invests with the FTMF, or 2) conditional match funding where every state dollar diverted from savings is matched up to a defined cap during the first 3–5 years.[^2_5][^2_3][^2_4]
- Clearly define that private/philanthropic capital does not buy control over state decisions but accelerates the fund’s ability to take on higher-risk, high-upside modernization projects early in the portfolio.


## Investment-style reporting model

- Have ODI manage the FTMF as a portfolio, with each modernization project treated as an “investment” that has: initial capital, projected savings, realized savings, and non-fiscal impact (service quality, equity, resilience, staff experience).[^2_6][^2_7][^2_8]
- Publish an annual “Modernization Portfolio Report” analogous to a private-sector fund letter, including:
    - Total capital deployed (state and Breakthrough/other partners).
    - Realized and projected savings, with the share returned to the General Fund and the share recycled into the fund.
    - Key “wins,” retirements of legacy risk, and reusable platforms or components created.[^2_9][^2_7][^2_8][^2_10]
- Provide Breakthrough partners with more granular dashboards and learning sessions rather than governance control, emphasizing co-learning and replication, similar to other cross-sector partnerships that share data while maintaining state decision authority.[^2_3][^2_4]


## How the feedback loop works with partners

- Early phase: Breakthrough and other partners seed the FTMF so ODI and the Governor’s Innovation Fellows can launch a first wave of projects that produce measurable efficiency gains and service improvements.[^2_11][^2_12][^2_13][^2_1]
- Maturity phase: As savings are verified and a fixed portion is diverted into the FTMF, the fund becomes increasingly sustained by internal state savings, allowing philanthropic and private partners to taper or redirect to riskier pilots rather than core operations.[^2_14][^2_15][^2_16][^2_5]
- Learning loop: ODI shares portfolio-level insights with Breakthrough partners and the broader tech/philanthropic community, demonstrating which modernization patterns work, which do not, and where co-investment can accelerate statewide scale.[^2_4][^2_1][^2_2][^2_3]
