## Key Concepts Developed Here

### Breakthrough Fund Feedback Loop
The `Breakthrough-seeding.md` document established the core concept: when modernization projects create efficiency savings, a portion of those savings is diverted into a fund for future modernization, creating a self-sustaining cycle.

### Fellowship Program Structure
The two-part Fellowship plan defined the 12-month program structure, cohort model, and the vision of Fellows as a "delivery engine" that scopes, delivers, and measures efficiency projects.

### Data Governance Teams
The `data-governance-teams.md` document explored interagency data sharing models and the role of the Office of State Data Governance.
