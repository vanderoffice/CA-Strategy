# California Enterprise Modernization Plan
## Executive Summary

**Prepared for:** Governor's Office, Office of Data and Innovation, Government Operations Agency
**Date:** December 2025
**Version:** Executive Draft v1.3

## The Problem

California state government lacks the natural forcing mechanism that drives private sector efficiency. Without market pressure, government agencies accumulate technical debt, maintain outdated systems, and perpetuate inefficient processes:

- Legacy systems consume **70-80%** of IT budgets
- Procurement cycles average **12-18 months**

---

## The Solution: The E3 Operational Model

The **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model** creates institutional accountability for modernization through three integrated components:

**1. Institutional Accountability** — New leadership positions with actual authority:
- *Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness* at Agency level (8-12 positions)
- *Chief Deputy Directors for Efficiency and Effectiveness* at Department level (30-40 positions)
- *Transformation Management Office (TMO)* within Government Operations Agency (GovOps) for statewide coordination

**2. Product-Led Delivery** — Modern approaches replacing waterfall:
- Service mesh architecture connecting systems via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- $15M modular contracting cap reducing vendor lock-in
- Request for Innovative Ideas (RFI²) procurement defining problems rather than prescribing solutions

**3. Data Governance Foundation** — Cross-branch authority:
- Independent Office of State Data Governance with 9-member board
- Standardized data sharing agreement templates (reducing 12-18 months to 4-8 weeks for common scenarios)
- Binding statewide data standards

---

## Talent Pipeline

The Governor's Innovation Fellowship produces 60 trained modernization leaders annually through 6-month cohorts. Permanent Data Governance Teams (438-530 positions statewide: 30 dedicated department teams plus 6-8 regional hubs) provide sustainable capacity.

See [Talent Development](03-talent-development.md) for details.

---

## Funding

The California Breakthrough Modernization Fund ($100M: 50% state, 50% private sector) uses portfolio management principles. A feedback loop diverts 25% of realized savings back to the fund, creating self-sustaining modernization capacity.

See [Funding & Implementation](04-funding-implementation.md) for details.

## Budget Summary

**Total Annual Operating Budget (Steady State - Year 3+):**

| Component | Annual Cost | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| E3 Leadership Positions | $10.0M - $16.7M | 8-12 Undersecretaries ($2.6M-$4.9M) + 30-40 Chief Deputy Directors ($7.4M-$11.8M) |
| Transformation Management Office | $4.1M - $5.4M | 16-23 staff ($3.1M-$4.4M) + operating costs ($1M) |
| Independent Office of Data Governance | $2.5M - $4.0M | Board, staff, and operations (one-time setup: $3M-$5M) |
| Governor's Innovation Fellowship | $1.3M - $1.8M | 60 Fellows annually across 3 cohorts ($8K-$12K per Fellow) |
| Data Governance Teams | $52.0M - $67.5M | 438-530 positions (30 dedicated teams + 6-8 regional hubs) |
| **Total Annual Operating (Year 3+)** | **$70M - $95M** | **Ongoing costs for sustained modernization capacity** |

**Initial Investment (Year 1):**
- Breakthrough Fund capitalization: $100M total ($50M state + $50M private sector, one-time)
- Operating budget ramp-up: $40M-$60M (partial deployment)
- Independent Office setup: $3M-$5M (one-time)
- **Total Year 1:** $143M-$165M

**Return on Investment:**
- Year 3 projected cost savings: $75M-$125M annually
- Year 5 cumulative savings: $200M-$350M
- Breakthrough Fund becomes 30-50% self-sustaining by Year 3 (25% savings reinvestment)

See [Appendix F: Budget and Financial Models](appendices/09-budget-and-governance.md#appendix-f-budget-and-financial-models) for detailed cost breakdowns and multi-year projections.

## Implementation Timeline

| Milestone | Deliverables |
|-----------|--------------|
| **6 Months** | 4 Undersecretaries appointed, TMO established, Fellowship Cohort 1 launched, 3-5 quick wins |
| **12 Months** | 10 Chief Deputy Directors deployed, Independent Office operational, $100M fund capitalized |
| **36 Months** | Full E3 deployment (8-12 Undersecretaries, 30-40 Chief Deputy Directors), 120+ Senior Fellows graduated, 50% digital adoption, 25% legacy reduction (40% by Year 5) |

---

## Recommended Actions

| Recommendation | Decision Owner | Suggested Timeline |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Approve E3 leadership structure (8-12 Undersecretaries, 30-40 CDDs) | Governor | Q1 2026 |
| Authorize $50M state contribution to Breakthrough Fund | Legislature | FY 2026-27 |
| Establish Independent Office of State Data Governance | Governor + Legislature | Q2 2026 |
| Issue Executive Order on $15M modular contracting cap | Governor | Q1 2026 |

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Executive Commitment** — Sustained support over 5+ years
2. **Actual Authority** — E3 roles must have line authority, not advisory roles
3. **Readiness-Based Deployment** — The Readiness Assessment Framework scores departments across 6 domains (Leadership and Governance; Data and Technology Infrastructure; Organizational Culture and Workforce; Cybersecurity and Risk; Service Delivery and Citizen Experience; Funding, Planning, and Portfolio Management) to prioritize E3 deployment where success probability is highest
4. **Quick Wins** — Demonstrable successes in Year 1 to build momentum
5. **Measurement Discipline** — Consistent tracking against defined Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

---

## Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Independent Office legislation delayed | Concurrent planning; interim committee |
| Resistance to change | Early quick wins; union engagement |
| Political transitions | Cross-branch structure; bipartisan framing |
| Vendor lock-in | Open standards; modular contracts |
| Federal AI policy preemption | Frame as service improvement and adoption (not regulation); leverage state procurement authority; document efficiency gains |
