### 5.4 Data Governance Teams (Permanent State Staff)

**Purpose:**

Provide sustainable capacity to support current Fellows' projects and sustain innovations after Fellows graduate to Senior Fellow status. Data governance teams are permanent civil service staff providing ongoing data management, quality, and integration capabilities.

These teams are also foundational to AI readiness. AI systems require high-quality, well-governed data to function effectively—and human oversight to ensure responsible use. Data governance teams provide both: they prepare the data AI needs and establish the oversight processes that ensure AI is used appropriately.

**Blended Expertise Model:**

Effective data governance requires combining domain expertise with technical data skills:

**Domain Specialists:**
- Scientists, engineers, and subject matter experts (existing classifications)
- Understand what data means, where it comes from, regulatory requirements
- Apply professional judgment to data quality and interpretation
- Ensure data governance aligns with programmatic needs

**Data Specialists:**
- Data architects, engineers, and analysts
- Build systems, pipelines, and integration infrastructure
- Implement technical data quality controls
- Enable self-service analytics and reporting

**Why Both Are Essential:**
- Domain specialists alone lack technical skills to implement solutions
- Data specialists alone lack context to make correct decisions about data
- Combined expertise delivers effective data governance

**Why Science and Engineering Classifications:**

**Higher Compensation:**
- Professional classifications pay 20-30% more than administrative equivalents
- Essential for recruiting talent with technical degrees and expertise
- Competitive with private sector data roles (though still 20-40% gap)

**Critical Thinking Skills:**
- Scientists and engineers trained in analytical thinking, experimentation, validation
- Apply scientific method to data problems
- Comfortable with uncertainty and complexity

**Domain Expertise:**
- Many government datasets require domain knowledge (environmental, engineering, health, public safety)
- Professional classifications enable hiring experts who understand the data

**Classification Alignment:**
- Consistent with how California already organizes technical work
- Leverages existing classification infrastructure
- Reduces HR complexity and approval challenges

**Professional Accountability:**

**Supervisory-Level Authority:**
- Supervisory classifications provide "responsible charge" over data systems and quality
- Similar to engineering supervisors responsible for project quality and safety
- Creates accountability for data governance outcomes

**Licensure (Where Applicable):**
- PE/PG licensure preferred for certain roles (engineering data systems, geospatial analysis)
- Professional ethics and standards applicable to data work
- Continuing education requirements keeping skills current

**Quality Requirements:**
- Classification standards embed scientific and engineering quality expectations
- Performance standards tied to data quality, accuracy, compliance
- Career advancement linked to demonstrated expertise and impact

**Deployment Strategy:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-12): Pilot Deployment**
- 3-5 pilot departments selected based on Readiness Assessment
- Full team deployment with intensive support from TMO and ODI
- Establish team operating models and best practices
- Document lessons learned for broader rollout

**Phase 2 (Months 13-24): Scaling**
- 15-20 departments receive data governance teams
- Leverage pilot learnings and templates
- Communities of Practice connecting teams across departments
- Shared services (e.g., data infrastructure, training) reducing duplication

**Phase 3 (Months 25-36): Statewide Deployment**
- Complete deployment to 30 departments with dedicated teams
- Establish 6-8 regional data governance hubs serving remaining departments
- Mature operating model and standards
- Self-sustaining communities supporting each other
- Integration with Office of State Data Governance standards

**Deployment Model:**

| Tier | Departments | Model | Staffing |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Tier 1-2** (Dedicated Teams) | 30 largest departments (~85% of IT spend) | Full 13-15 FTE data governance team | 390-450 positions |
| **Tier 3-4** (Shared Services) | 140 smaller departments | Regional hub support + TMO technical assistance | 6-8 hubs × 8-10 FTE = 48-80 positions |
| **Total** | 170 departments | Hybrid model | **438-530 positions** |

**Regional Hub Structure:**
- 6-8 hubs geographically distributed (Northern CA, Bay Area, Central Valley, Greater LA, etc.)
- Each hub serves 15-25 smaller departments
- Hub services: data quality consulting, standards implementation, training, technical assistance
- Departments retain ownership; hubs provide expertise and surge capacity

**Expected Impact:**
- 95%+ data quality for critical datasets (up from 60-70% baseline)
- 80% reduction in data sharing negotiation time (from 12-18 months to 4-8 weeks for standard scenarios using templates)
- 50%+ increase in data-driven decision making (measured by analytics tool usage)
- 438-530 permanent civil service positions created (390-450 in dedicated teams, 48-80 in regional hubs)
- Sustainable capacity independent of Fellowship program or external consultants
