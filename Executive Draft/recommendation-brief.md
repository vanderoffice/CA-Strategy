## Summary

> **What This Is:** A recommendation to modernize California state government through dedicated leadership, modern procurement, and sustainable funding.

This brief summarizes the recommended Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model. The full recommendation is documented in companion documents:

- [Governance Model](governance-model.md) — E3 structure, leadership roles, and data governance
- [Talent Development](talent-development.md) — Fellowship program and workforce development
- [Funding & Implementation](funding-implementation.md) — Breakthrough Fund and implementation roadmap
- [Procurement Guide](procurement-guide.md) — Technology and procurement innovation
- [Operational Appendices](operational-appendices.md) — Templates and operational guides
- [Technical Appendices](technical-appendices.md) — Standards, assessments, and reference materials

## Recommended Actions

| Recommendation | Decision Owner | Suggested Timeline |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Approve E3 leadership structure (8-12 Undersecretaries, 30-40 CDDs) | Governor | Q1 2026 |
| Authorize $50M state contribution to Breakthrough Fund | Legislature | FY 2026-27 |
| Establish Independent Office of State Data Governance | Governor + Legislature | Q2 2026 |
| Issue Executive Order on $15M modular contracting cap | Governor | Q1 2026 |

---

## Three Numbers That Matter

| Metric | Value | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **$100M** | Breakthrough Modernization Fund | 50% state + 50% private; projected self-sustaining by Year 5-7 |
| **$15M** | Recommended modular contract cap | Reduces mega-project risk; increases competition |
| **60/year** | Innovation Fellows | Continuous pipeline of trained modernization leaders |

## Recommended Implementation Timeline

```
MONTH 1-6                    MONTH 7-12                   MONTH 13-36
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
▸ 4 E3 Undersecretaries     ▸ 10 E3 CDDs deployed        ▸ Full deployment
▸ TMO established           ▸ $100M fund capitalized     ▸ 30-40 CDDs
▸ Fellowship Cohort 1       ▸ Data Governance Office     ▸ 120+ Fellows
▸ 3-5 quick wins            ▸ Vendor pools operational   ▸ 50% digital adoption
▸ Readiness assessments     ▸ First RFI² challenges      ▸ 25% legacy reduction*
```

*Legacy reduction target: 25% by Year 3, 40% by Year 5

## Recommended Ownership Model

| Role | Recommended Responsibility |
|------|----------------------------|
| **Governor's Office** | Executive orders, appointments, legislative strategy |
| **GovOps** | TMO oversight, cross-agency coordination, fund governance |
| **ODI** | Methodology, Fellowship program, Breakthrough Fund management |
| **Agency Secretaries** | E3 Undersecretary supervision, agency-wide adoption |
| **Department Directors** | E3 CDD supervision, department modernization execution |

---

## Why We Believe This Will Work

| Past Failure Mode | How This Recommendation Addresses It |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| No dedicated ownership | E3 Undersecretaries/CDDs with explicit authority |
| Advisory roles ignored | Line authority over budgets, procurement, technology |
| Multi-year procurement | Rapid RFI² designed to deliver validated solutions in 8-10 weeks |
| Mega-projects fail | $15M modular cap limits blast radius |
| No sustained funding | 25% savings reinvestment creates self-sustaining fund |
| Talent shortage | 60 Fellows/year + permanent Data Governance Teams |

---

## The Core Problem This Addresses

California state government lacks the natural forcing mechanism that drives private sector efficiency. Without market pressure, government agencies accumulate technical debt, maintain outdated systems, and perpetuate inefficient processes:

- Legacy systems consume **70-80%** of IT budgets
- Procurement cycles average **18-24 months**
- Only **35-40%** of transactions are completable online

---

## The Recommended Solution: E3 Operational Model

The **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model** would create institutional accountability for modernization through three integrated components:

**1. Institutional Accountability** — New leadership positions with actual authority:
- *Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness* at Agency level (8-12 positions)
- *Chief Deputy Directors for Efficiency and Effectiveness* at Department level (30-40 positions)
- *Transformation Management Office (TMO)* within GovOps for statewide coordination

**2. Product-Led Delivery** — Modern approaches replacing waterfall:
- Service mesh architecture connecting systems via APIs
- $15M modular contracting cap reducing vendor lock-in
- RFI² procurement defining problems rather than prescribing solutions

**3. Data Governance Foundation** — Cross-branch authority (requires enabling legislation):
- Independent Office of State Data Governance with 9-member board
- Standardized data sharing agreement templates (reducing 18 months to 4-8 weeks for common scenarios)
- Binding statewide data standards

**Talent Pipeline:** The Governor's Innovation Fellowship would produce 60 trained modernization leaders annually through 6-month cohorts. Permanent Data Governance Teams (400-600 positions statewide) would provide sustainable capacity.

**Funding:** The California Breakthrough Modernization Fund ($100M: 50% state, 50% private sector) would use portfolio management principles. A feedback loop diverting 25% of realized savings back to the fund would create self-sustaining modernization capacity.

## Critical Success Factors

For this recommendation to succeed, we believe the following are essential:

1. **Executive Commitment** — Sustained support over 5+ years
2. **Actual Authority** — E3 roles must have line authority, not advisory roles
3. **Readiness-Based Deployment** — Using the Readiness Assessment framework to prioritize
4. **Quick Wins** — Demonstrable successes in Year 1 to build momentum
5. **Measurement Discipline** — Consistent tracking against defined OKRs

## Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Independent Office legislation delayed | Concurrent legislative and planning work; interim steering committee if needed |
| Resistance to change | No-blame experimentation zones; union engagement early; quick wins |
| Political transitions | Cross-branch Independent Office structure; bipartisan framing |
| Vendor lock-in | Open standards; modular contracting; API-first architecture |
