## 6. The California Breakthrough Modernization Fund

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes a $100M fund with 50% state and 50% private sector contributions, governed by portfolio management principles with a sustainability mechanism that reinvests 25% of realized savings.

### 6.1 Fund Purpose and Structure

**Fund Overview:**

The California Breakthrough Modernization Fund (Breakthrough Fund) capitalizes modernization initiatives, specifically the Fellowship program and the E3 positions. Unlike traditional government budgets that require annual appropriation battles, the Breakthrough Fund operates with multi-year investment authority using portfolio management principles.

**Why a Dedicated Fund:**

**Multi-Year Horizon:**
- Modernization projects span 2-5 years; annual budget uncertainty disrupts delivery
- Fund provides stable, predictable investment capacity
- Political transitions don't interrupt in-flight initiatives
- Long-term thinking enabled by long-term funding

**Portfolio Approach:**
- Not all investments succeed; portfolio management expects and accounts for failure
- Higher-risk/higher-reward initiatives funded alongside proven approaches
- Cross-subsidy: successful projects generate savings that fund future projects
- Diversified investment reduces catastrophic failure risk

**Speed and Flexibility:**
- Pre-authorized funding for approved project types
- Reduced approval cycles (weeks instead of months)
- Rapid response to opportunities (emerging technologies, partnership offers)
- Pilot funding available without annual budget process

**Accountability:**
- Clear success metrics and public reporting
- Performance-based continuation (projects that fail don't get refunded)
- Transparency to Legislature, press, and public
- Private sector co-investment creates external accountability

### 6.2 Funding Sources

**Public Sector Allocation (50%):**

| Source | Amount | Notes |

### 6.4 Governance and Oversight

**Investment Committee:**

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| GovOps Secretary (Chair) | Final investment approval |
| TMO Director | Portfolio management, performance tracking |
| ODI Director | Innovation and methodology guidance |
| CDT Director | Technology architecture and security review |
| Department of Finance Rep | Budget compliance and fiscal oversight |
| Breakthrough Partner Rep (rotating) | Private sector perspective, co-investment decisions |

**Decision Authority:**
- Quick Wins (<$500K): TMO Director with Investment Committee notification
- Strategic Initiatives ($500K-$5M): Investment Committee approval
- Innovation Ventures: Investment Committee approval with technical review

**Investment Criteria:**

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Strategic Alignment | 25% | Alignment with E3 goals, statewide priorities |
| Citizen Impact | 25% | Measurable improvement in service delivery |
| Readiness | 20% | Department Readiness Assessment score, team capability |
| ROI Potential | 15% | Projected savings, efficiency gains |
| Scalability | 15% | Replicability across other departments |

**Stage-Gate Reviews:**
- All investments subject to stage-gate reviews (planning, development, deployment, operations)
- Go/no-go decisions at each gate based on progress and risk assessment
- Underperforming projects redirected or terminated early
- Lessons learned captured regardless of outcome

### 6.5 Sustainability Mechanism

**Reinvestment Model:**

The Breakthrough Fund includes a sustainability mechanism that diverts a portion of realized savings back to the fund, creating self-sustaining modernization capacity.

**Savings Calculation:**
- Projects track baseline costs (before modernization)
- Post-implementation costs measured for 12-24 months
- Verified savings calculated: (Baseline - Post-Implementation) × Duration
- Third-party validation for savings above $1M

**Reinvestment Rate:** 25% of verified savings

**Example:**
| Element | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Investment | $2M (cloud migration) |
| Annual savings realized | $800K |
| 25% reinvestment | $200K/year |
| After 5 years | $1M returned to fund |
| Net fund position | -$1M investment + $1M return = break-even, with ongoing $600K/year agency benefit |

**Reinvestment Allocation:**
- 50% to Quick Wins (maintain momentum)
- 30% to Strategic Initiatives (sustain major modernization)
- 20% to Innovation Ventures (continue exploration)

**Long-Term Sustainability:**

| Year | Investments | Savings Realized | Reinvestment | Fund Balance |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | $30M | $2M | $0.5M | $70.5M |
| 2 | $30M | $8M | $2M | $42.5M |
| 3 | $25M | $15M | $3.75M | $21.25M |
| 4 | $20M | $20M | $5M | $6.25M |
| 5 | $10M | $25M | $6.25M | $2.5M (+ ongoing reinvestment) |

*Note: Fund projected to become self-sustaining by Year 5-7 through reinvestment of realized savings*

*For detailed sustainability calculations and projections, see [Appendix A.11: Breakthrough Fund Sustainability Model](06-operational-appendices.md#a11-breakthrough-fund-sustainability-model).*

## 8. Conclusion

> **Section Summary:** This section synthesizes the strategic vision and calls to action for California's enterprise modernization.

California state government can become as efficient, effective, and innovative as the best private sector organizations while maintaining public sector values of equity, transparency, and accessibility. The E3 Operational Model provides the institutional forcing mechanism government currently lacks: dedicated leaders with actual authority, sustainable funding, and continuous talent development.

**The Components Work Together:**

- **E3 Leaders** (Undersecretaries and Chief Deputy Directors) provide persistent focus and authority
- **Independent Office of State Data Governance** enables cross-agency data sharing with enforceable standards
- **Governor's Innovation Fellowship** builds continuous pipeline of trained modernization leaders
- **Data Governance Teams** sustain innovations and provide permanent capability
- **Breakthrough Fund** provides stable, performance-based funding with private sector partnership
- **Product-Led Delivery** enables rapid, iterative improvement with citizen-centered design

**The Cost of Inaction:**

Without structural intervention, California will continue:
- Spending 70-80% of IT budgets on legacy maintenance
- Waiting 18-24 months for procurement cycles
- Forcing citizens to navigate fragmented, paper-based services
- Losing technical talent to private sector
- Accumulating technical debt and security vulnerabilities
- Falling further behind peer states and private sector benchmarks

**The Opportunity:**

With the E3 Operational Model, California can:
- Redirect IT spending toward innovation and citizen services
- Reduce procurement timelines to weeks instead of months
- Deliver seamless, digital-first citizen experiences
- Attract and retain world-class technical talent
- Build sustainable modernization capacity that compounds over time
- Lead the nation in government digital transformation

**The Path Forward:**

This plan requires courage: courage to create new positions with real authority, courage to invest in long-term transformation, courage to measure and be accountable, courage to learn from failures. But the alternative—continued decline, increasing costs, deteriorating services—is not acceptable.

California has the scale, the resources, and the talent to demonstrate that government can work. The E3 Operational Model provides the structure. The Breakthrough Fund provides the resources. The Fellowship provides the people. What remains is the will to act.

**Recommendations for Immediate Action:**

1. **Appoint first 4 Undersecretaries** to priority agencies (GovOps, CalHHS, Transportation, Corrections)
2. **Establish Transformation Management Office** within GovOps with initial staffing
3. **Launch Governor's Innovation Fellowship** with first cohort of 20 Fellows
4. **Secure initial Breakthrough Fund appropriation** ($30M state, $20M private sector Year 1)
5. **Complete Readiness Assessment pilot** with 3 diverse departments
6. **Identify and fund 5 Quick Win projects** for early momentum

The path to successful modernization begins with these first steps. California's 40 million residents deserve a government that works as well as the best organizations they interact with. The E3 Operational Model makes this possible.
