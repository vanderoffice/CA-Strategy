### B.1 Rapid RFI² Operational Guide

This appendix provides detailed operational guidance for executing Rapid RFI² challenges. For the strategic overview, see [Section 9.4: Rapid RFI²](../05-procurement-guide.md#94-rapid-rfi-challenge-based-procurement).

---

**Phase 1: Problem Statement (Weeks 1-3)**

Cross-functional team (program staff, IT, E3 leaders, ODI) defines:

**Problem Statement Components:**
- **Current State:** What's broken? (quantified with specific metrics)
- **Target Metric:** What does success look like? (specific, measurable outcomes)
- **Constraints:** Budget, timeline, must-integrate-with systems, regulatory requirements
- **Evaluation Criteria:** How prototypes will be judged (weighted criteria)

**Team Composition:**
- Program SME (understands the business problem)
- IT representative (understands technical landscape)
- E3 CDD or designee (owns decision authority)
- ODI advisor (ensures human-centered design principles)
- TMO Challenge Manager (manages logistics)

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Problem is outcome-focused, not solution-prescriptive
- [ ] Metrics are specific and measurable
- [ ] Constraints are realistic and documented
- [ ] Evaluation criteria are objective and weighted
- [ ] Timeline allows for vendor preparation

**Example Problem Statement:**

> **Challenge:** Foster care application processing takes 45 days average. Staff spend 40% of time re-keying data from PDF forms into the case management system. 60% of applications require manual review due to missing or inconsistent data.
>
> **Target:** Reduce processing time to <5 days. Achieve 85% auto-adjudication rate for complete applications.
>
> **Constraint:** Must integrate with Legacy System X via existing API. Must comply with HIPAA and state privacy requirements. Budget envelope: $50K per prototype, $5M for production implementation.
>
> **We seek:** A partner to prototype a solution demonstrating how caseworkers can achieve these targets. We are not prescribing technology stack, provided it adheres to State Technology Standards (Appendix H).

### B.3 Breakthrough Fund Sustainability Model

This appendix provides a detailed worked example of how the Breakthrough Fund sustainability model operates. For the strategic overview, see [Section 6.4: Sustainability Mechanism](../04-funding-implementation.md#64-sustainability-mechanism).

---

**Worked Example: Business Licensing Automation**

**Step 1: Project Delivers Measurable Savings**

A Breakthrough Fund investment of $3M modernizes business licensing across three agencies:
- Processing time reduced from 45 days to 3 days
- Staffing reduced from 20 FTE to 8 FTE through automation
- Staff reassigned to higher-value work (compliance, outreach)

**Savings Calculation:**
- 12 FTE positions no longer needed for processing
- Average loaded cost per FTE: $100,000/year
- **Annual cost reduction: $1.2M**

---

**Step 2: Department Budget Adjusted**

Following validation of sustained savings (typically 1 fiscal year of demonstrated performance):
- Department baseline budget reduced by $1.2M
- Reduction implemented in subsequent fiscal year
- Staff reassignment or attrition managed through normal HR processes

---

**Step 3: Fixed 25% Diverted to Breakthrough Fund**

Per policy, 25% of realized savings flow back to the Breakthrough Fund:
- 25% of $1.2M = **$300K diverted to Breakthrough Fund annually**
- 75% of $1.2M = **$900K returns to General Fund**

This continues for the life of the project (typically 5-7 years before system refresh required).

---

**Step 4: Reinvestment Creates Next Generation Projects**

The $300K annual contribution funds new modernization:
- Year 1: $300K available
- Year 2: $600K cumulative (if no new projects funded)
- Years 3-5: As more projects mature, contributions compound

**Portfolio Effect:**

| Year | Active Projects | Annual Savings Generated | 25% to Fund | Cumulative Fund Growth |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | 5 pilots | $2M | $500K | $500K |
| 2 | 10 projects | $6M | $1.5M | $2M |
| 3 | 18 projects | $12M | $3M | $5M |
| 4 | 25 projects | $20M | $5M | $10M |
| 5 | 30 projects | $30M | $7.5M | $17.5M |

---

**Self-Sustainability Threshold**

The fund becomes self-sustaining when annual reinvestment inflows equal or exceed annual investment needs:

- **Target annual investment capacity:** $15-20M (10-15 new projects per year)
- **Required annual savings generation:** $60-80M (to produce $15-20M at 25%)
- **Estimated time to self-sustainability:** 5-7 years from initial $100M capitalization

At self-sustainability:
- Private sector partners can exit or continue
- General Fund contribution no longer required
- Fund operates as permanent modernization engine

---

**Risk Factors and Mitigation**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Projects don't deliver savings | Stage-gate process kills underperformers early |
| Savings not captured in budget | TMO tracks savings; automatic budget adjustment policy |
| Departments resist budget reduction | Savings reinvested in department priorities; not purely extractive |
| Political pressure to redirect funds | Statutory protection for 25% diversion; transparent reporting |
| Diminishing returns (low-hanging fruit exhausted) | See Long-Term Sustainability Note below |

**Long-Term Sustainability Note:**

This model assumes continued discovery of modernization opportunities with at least 60% ROI. As early Quick Wins are completed, remaining opportunities may be more complex and expensive with lower returns. If annual reinvestment drops below $10M by Year 6:

1. **Trigger Review:** TMO conducts strategic assessment of remaining modernization backlog
2. **Options:** (a) Expand scope to include operational efficiency beyond IT, (b) Increase reinvestment percentage from 25% to 35%, (c) Request General Fund supplemental appropriation
3. **Contingency:** State commits to baseline funding (~$10M/year) if self-sustainability not achieved by Year 7

The goal is self-sustainability, but modernization is too important to abandon if the financial model requires adjustment.

---

### B.4 Labor Relations Strategy

This appendix provides guidance for engaging labor unions in enterprise modernization initiatives. Successful modernization requires partnership with labor organizations representing state employees.

---

**Guiding Principles**

1. **No Layoffs from Modernization:** Efficiency gains redirect staff to higher-value work, not unemployment
2. **Upskilling Over Displacement:** Training programs prepare workers for evolving roles
3. **Early Engagement:** Labor consulted before, not after, modernization decisions
4. **Transparency:** Clear communication about timelines, impacts, and opportunities
5. **Shared Benefits:** Productivity gains benefit both service delivery and workforce

---

**Classification and Compensation Considerations**

**New Position Development:**
- Data governance teams require new or modified classifications
- Coordinate with CalHR and relevant bargaining units on position specifications
- Ensure competitive compensation to attract technical talent (see Section 5.4 on science/engineering classifications)

**Career Pathways:**
- Define clear advancement paths from technician to specialist to senior roles
- Recognize certifications and skill development in classification requirements
- Enable mobility between departments for career growth

**Meet and Confer Requirements:**
- Engage unions early on new position classifications
- Provide advance notice of organizational changes
- Document agreements and implementation timelines

---

**Workforce Transition Framework**

**When Automation Reduces Workload:**

| Phase | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Assessment | Identify affected positions | 6+ months before go-live |
| Notification | Inform employees and unions | 4+ months before go-live |
| Options | Present reassignment, retraining, or attrition choices | 3+ months before go-live |
| Transition | Execute reassignments, begin training | At go-live |
| Support | Continued training and adjustment | 6-12 months post go-live |

**Attrition Management:**
- Natural attrition (retirements, voluntary departures) absorbs most position reductions
- Hiring freezes in affected classifications accelerate attrition-based reduction
- No involuntary separations from modernization initiatives

**Enforcement of No-Layoff Commitment:**

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Monitoring** | TMO tracks all separations monthly; flags any coded as "modernization-related" |
| **Reporting** | Quarterly reports to Governor's Office and labor unions on workforce transitions |
| **Escalation** | Departments proposing layoffs must demonstrate: (1) exhausted reassignment options, (2) offered retraining, (3) attrition timeline infeasible. TMO Director and CalHR Deputy Director must concur before any exception. |
| **Consequences** | Departments violating commitment lose access to Breakthrough Fund, face E3 leader performance review |
| **Employee Remedy** | Affected employees may appeal to CalHR; reinstatement + back pay if separation found improper |

**Reassignment Priorities:**
1. Within same department to higher-value work
2. To growing functions (data governance, customer service, compliance)
3. To other departments with needs matching employee skills
4. To new positions created by modernization

---

**Union Engagement Protocol**

**Statewide Level:**
- TMO briefs statewide union leadership quarterly on modernization initiatives
- Formal meet and confer on policies affecting represented employees
- Union representatives invited to Breakthrough Fund review committees

**Department Level:**
- E3 leaders include labor relations in modernization planning
- Advance consultation on workflow changes affecting bargaining unit work
- Regular communication through established labor-management committees

**Project Level:**
- Include union consultation in project stage-gate criteria
- Document workforce impact assessments
- Track and report on job transitions

---

**Training Coordination**

**Digital Accelerators Program Integration:**
- Coordinate training schedules with workload and staffing requirements
- Ensure protected learning time (20% of work hours) is operationally feasible
- Partner with unions on training curriculum relevant to represented employees

**Certification Recognition:**
- Work with CalHR to recognize industry certifications in classification specifications
- Enable pay differentials for certified skills where appropriate
- Document certification requirements in duty statements

---

**Success Metrics**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Employees displaced (involuntary separation) | 0 |
| Employees successfully reassigned | 100% of affected |
| Training completion rate | 95%+ |
| Union grievances related to modernization | <5 per year statewide |
| Employee satisfaction with transition | >70% positive |

---

**Escalation Path**

Unresolved labor issues escalate through:
1. Department labor relations → Agency labor relations
2. Agency labor relations → CalHR Labor Relations Division
3. CalHR → State Mediation and Conciliation Service (if needed)
4. Critical issues → TMO and Governor's Office awareness
