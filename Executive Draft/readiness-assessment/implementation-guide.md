## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This implementation guide details the procedures for conducting the California State Government Technology Readiness Assessment across all 170 state departments. The assessment forms the basis of objective, data-driven allocation of technology modernization funding to departments that can immediately begin work and deliver successful outcomes.

### Assessment Objectives
- Establish a standardized baseline of organizational readiness across all state departments
- Identify departments best positioned to execute modernization projects now
- Surface gaps for targeted capacity investments
- Create transparent, defensible criteria for funding allocation
- Enable continuous improvement through reassessment

### Key Principles
- **Objectivity**: Use of standardized scoring criteria across all domains
- **Transparency**: Clearly defined scales and rating examples
- **Actionability**: Results provide specific actionable guidance
- **Comprehensiveness**: Evaluates all dimensions of readiness
- **Practicality**: Designed for departments of all sizes and structures

- CISO or ISO
- HR/Workforce lead
- PMO Director
- Strategic Planning Lead or Chief of Staff
**Executive Reviewer**: Department Director or Agency Head

### 2.3 Preparing Materials
Required:
- Full assessment instrument (all domains and indicators)
- Detailed scoring rubrics (1-5 scale examples)
- Evidence template (recommended)
- Assessment submission portal (or email)
- Training webinar/orientation slide deck
Communication Package:
- Executive memo (Governor's Office/CDT Director)
- FAQ for common issues
- Timeline & clear milestones
- Technical assistance contacts

### 2.4 Conducting Orientation & Training
**Webinar (60–90 min):**
- Overview and context
- Walkthrough of all domains and indicators
- Scoring scales explained (with examples)

- Live Q&A; submission instructions
Support:
- Weekly office hours
- Dedicated email support
- Resource portal with FAQs & sample evidence

## 3. Step-by-Step Assessment Procedures

**Phase 1: Internal Team Formation (Week 1)**
- Assemble assessment team
- Kickoff meeting, assign domains, set internal schedule
- Review instrument & attend orientation
- Gather documentation

**Phase 2: Domain Assessment (Weeks 2–4)**
- Each lead completes their domain section using 1-5 scales/examples
- Team reviews ratings & evidence
- Cross-checks for scoring consistency
- Present draft results for executive input
- Finalize ratings by consensus and with leadership

**Phase 3: Submission & Validation (Week 5)**
- Complete and compile final form and supporting documentation
- Executive sign-off with transmittal memo
- Submit via portal or email
- Respond to follow-up/clarification requests

**Phase 4: Results & Planning (Week 6+)**
- Departments receive results, peer and statewide analyses
- High-readiness: Begin project proposals for funding
- Medium- and lower-readiness: Draft and submit improvement plans
- Begin tracking of continuous improvement cycle

## 4. Scoring and Evaluation Guidelines

### 4.1 Indicator Scoring
Each indicator is rated 1-5 (see scoring rubrics/examples). Scores:
- 1: Initial/ad-hoc (little/no formal capability)
- 2: Emerging (some initial, sporadic efforts)
- 3: Developing (formal practices emerging, inconsistent)
- 4: Managed (well-documented, consistent)
- 5: Optimized (mature, best-in-class, continuous improvement)

- Score honestly: choose lower score if uncertain
- Document rationale, especially for 1 or 5
- Use evidence (audits, project records, documentation)

### 4.2 Domain Scoring
- Average indicator scores within a domain (rounded to 1 decimal place)
- Apply indicator-specific weights if instructed

### 4.3 Overall Readiness Score
Default weights:
- Leadership & Governance: 20%
- Data/Technology Infrastructure: 20%
- Culture & Workforce: 15%
- Cybersecurity & Risk: 15%
- Service/Citizen Experience: 15%
- Planning/Portfolio Management: 15%

**Calculated as:**
  (Domain Score x Weight) summed, out of 5.0

### 4.4 Tier Classification
- Tier 1 (Score 4.0–5.0): Ready Now – Fundable
- Tier 2 (3.0–3.9): Near-Ready – Fund with targeted support
- Tier 3 (2.0–2.9): Developing – Focus on gap closure
- Tier 4 (1.0–1.9): Early Stage – Foundational capacity building

---

## 5. Results Analysis and Interpretation

### 5.1 Statewide Results
- Aggregate and analyze all results: mean, median, standard deviation, outliers
- Segment by size, mission, or budget for benchmarking
- Identify domain-level strengths/weaknesses statewide

### 5.2 Department Results Interpretation
- Analyze strengths (high domain scores)
- Analyze gaps (lowest scores, root causes)
- Assess readiness balance and "fatal flaws"
- Set improvement priorities and estimate investment/timelines required

---

## 6. Funding Allocation Recommendations

### 6.1 Tier 1 (4.0–5.0)
- Immediate funding through Tech Modernization Fund
- Fast-track approval/minor oversight
- Fund large, transformative projects upon strong proposal

### 6.2 Tier 2 (3.0–3.9)
- Conditional/project funding with required improvement plan for gaps
- Enhanced CDT oversight/technical assistance
- Stage in large investments as capacity builds

### 6.3 Tier 3 (2.0–2.9)
- Invest in organizational capability building, not modernization projects
- Provide technical assistance, training, mentoring
- 12–18 month gap-closure roadmap before major projects

### 6.4 Tier 4 (1.0–1.9)
- No project funding; foundational organizational development only
- May require external or embedded improvement support
- 24–36 month transformation roadmap

---

## 7. Capability Development Planning
**For Tiers 2–4:**
- Prioritize 2–3 vital improvements for initial focus
- Set specific and measurable goals and timelines
- Identify support/resources: budget, assistance, training, leadership commitment
- Assign accountable executive sponsor
- Set milestones, schedule reassessment (quarterly/annually)

### Statewide Capability Initiatives
- Develop standard training/workshops (governance, cloud, project management, UX, change management)
- Encourage peer networks (CIO, security, project management)
- Offer technical assistance and best-practice templates

### Continuous Improvement Cycle
- Reassess readiness annually
- Analyze trends, publish best practices and case studies
- Adjust funding/support strategies according to improvement
