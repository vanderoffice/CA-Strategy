| **4** | Managed | Consistent execution, measurable outcomes |
| **5** | Optimized | Continuous improvement, industry-leading |

### Readiness Tiers

| Tier | Score | Funding Approach |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **Tier 1** | 4.0-5.0 | Ready Now — Priority funding for high-impact projects |
| **Tier 2** | 3.0-3.9 | Near-Ready — Conditional funding with capability-building |
| **Tier 3** | 2.0-2.9 | Developing — Capacity-building grants, not project funding |
| **Tier 4** | 1.0-1.9 | Early Stage — Foundational organizational development |
