## Executive Summary

California state government lacks the natural forcing mechanism that drives private sector efficiency. Without market pressure, government agencies accumulate technical debt, maintain outdated systems, and perpetuate inefficient processes. Legacy systems consume 70-80% of IT budgets; procurement cycles average 18-24 months; only 35-40% of transactions are completable online.

**The Solution: The E3 Operational Model**

The **Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model** creates institutional accountability for modernization through three integrated components:

1. **Institutional Accountability** — New leadership positions with actual authority:
   - *Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness* at Agency level (8-12 positions)
   - *Chief Deputy Directors for Efficiency and Effectiveness* at Department level (30-40 positions)
   - *Transformation Management Office (TMO)* within GovOps for statewide coordination

2. **Product-Led Delivery** — Modern approaches replacing waterfall:
   - Service mesh architecture connecting systems via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
   - $15M modular contracting cap reducing vendor lock-in
   - Request for Innovative Ideas (RFI²) procurement defining problems rather than prescribing solutions

3. **Data Governance Foundation** — Cross-branch authority:
   - Independent Office of State Data Governance with 9-member board
   - Standardized data sharing agreement templates (reducing 18 months to 4-8 weeks for common scenarios)
   - Binding statewide data standards

**Talent Pipeline:** The Governor's Innovation Fellowship produces 60 trained modernization leaders annually through 6-month cohorts. Permanent Data Governance Teams (400-600 positions statewide) provide sustainable capacity. See [Talent Development](talent-development.md) for details.

**Funding:** The California Breakthrough Modernization Fund ($100M: 50% state, 50% private sector) uses portfolio management principles. A feedback loop diverts 25% of realized savings back to the fund, creating self-sustaining modernization capacity. See [Funding & Implementation](funding-implementation.md) for details.

**Implementation Timeline:**
- **6 Months:** 4 Undersecretaries appointed, TMO established, Fellowship Cohort 1 launched, 3-5 quick wins
- **12 Months:** 10 Chief Deputy Directors deployed, Independent Office operational, $100M fund capitalized
- **36 Months:** Full E3 deployment (8-12 Undersecretaries, 30-40 Chief Deputy Directors), 120+ Senior Fellows graduated, 50% digital adoption, 25% legacy reduction (40% by Year 5)

**Critical Success Factors:** Executive commitment (5+ years), actual authority (not advisory roles), readiness-based deployment using the Readiness Assessment framework, quick wins in Year 1, and measurement discipline.

## 1. Strategic Foundation

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes the vision, mission, and guiding principles for California's modernization, explains why government lacks natural efficiency mechanisms, and describes how ODI and GovOps serve as foundational partners.

### 1.1 Vision Statement

California state government operates with the efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation of leading organizations while maintaining public sector values of equity, transparency, and accessibility. Every Californian experiences government services that are digital-first, user-centered, and seamlessly integrated across agencies—delivered through empowered teams using modern tools, shared data, and continuous improvement practices that make government as responsive as the best private sector organizations.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

Transform California's government operations through the Enterprise Efficiency and Effectiveness (E3) Operational Model, creating institutional forcing mechanisms that drive continuous improvement, technological modernization, and excellence in public service delivery. By establishing empowered leadership positions, independent data governance, continuous talent development, and sustainable funding mechanisms, California will demonstrate that government can deliver exceptional outcomes while remaining accountable, transparent, and equitable.

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

**Citizen-Centric Design**
Every technology investment and process change must demonstrably improve citizen experiences. User research, accessibility testing, and satisfaction measurement inform all decisions. Services should be organized around life experiences—not organizational charts. Government exists to serve people, and every system, process, and policy should reflect that fundamental purpose.

**Evidence-Based Decision Making**
Data, metrics, and rigorous evaluation guide resource allocation, project prioritization, and performance assessment. The Readiness Assessment framework ensures strategic deployment of resources based on department preparedness, reducing risk and maximizing probability of success. Transparency in both successes and failures enables organizational learning. What gets measured gets managed; what gets shared gets improved.

**Actual Authority**
E3 leaders and governance bodies must have real decision-making power over technology investments, data sharing mandates, procurement approvals, and performance accountability—not merely advisory roles. The Independent Office structure and E3 leadership positions provide enforceable authority that transcends traditional agency boundaries. Without authority, modernization becomes optional; with authority, it becomes inevitable.

**Readiness-Based Deployment**
Not all departments are equally prepared for modernization. Strategic use of the Readiness Assessment framework ensures resources flow to departments positioned for success, creating early wins that build momentum rather than premature failures that generate resistance. This principle recognizes that transformation requires capability, not just commitment.

**Open and Collaborative**
California's modernization serves as an open-source model for peer states. Collaboration with private sector partners, academic institutions, ODI expertise, and other governments accelerates progress. Breakthrough Fund partners co-invest and co-learn, creating replicable patterns applicable beyond California. Open innovation multiplies impact.

**Equity and Inclusion**
Digital transformation must not create new barriers for underserved populations. Multi-language support, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum), digital literacy programs, and alternative service channels ensure universal access. Services must be designed with—not just for—the communities they serve. Technology should reduce disparities, not amplify them.

**Sustainable and Scalable**
Solutions must work at California's scale (40 million residents, 170 departments, 230,000+ employees) and remain maintainable over decades. Avoid bespoke systems and proprietary vendor lock-in. Prefer cheap, scalable, self-supportable innovative solutions over giant monolithic systems that create long-term dependencies and technical debt. Sustainability means both financial and operational longevity.

**Security and Privacy by Design**
Cybersecurity, data privacy (CCPA compliance), and ethical AI use are embedded from project inception, not added retrospectively. Every data sharing agreement, every API, every system must meet stringent security standards appropriate to data sensitivity. Trust is California's most valuable asset—and most fragile.

### 1.4 The Core Problem

Private sector organizations face market-driven pressure to optimize operations. Poor efficiency leads to higher costs, reduced competitiveness, declining revenue, and potential business failure. This forcing mechanism drives continuous improvement, innovation, and accountability. Companies that fail to adapt cease to exist.

Government agencies operate without this pressure. Budget allocations continue regardless of operational efficiency. Services remain monopolistic—citizens cannot choose alternative providers. Technology systems persist decades beyond useful life because replacement lacks urgency. Poor performance rarely triggers consequences; risk-averse cultures prioritize stability over improvement. The incentive structure rewards maintaining the status quo.

**Measurable Consequences (2024-2025 Data):**

- **Legacy System Crisis:** Legacy systems consume 70-80% of IT budgets, leaving 20-30% for innovation, modernization, and new capabilities. The average age of critical government systems exceeds 25 years, with some mainframe systems dating to the 1970s and early 1980s. These systems require increasingly scarce technical expertise (COBOL, Fortran, AS/400) and face mounting failure risks.

- **Data Fragmentation:** Over 400 independent systems across state government prevent information sharing, forcing citizens to provide the same information multiple times to different agencies. Data sharing agreements take 18 months on average to negotiate and execute, creating barriers to cross-agency collaboration and integrated service delivery.

- **Procurement Delays:** Traditional procurement cycles average 18-24 months from requirement definition to contract award, delaying technology adoption by years and compounding costs. Large monolithic contracts create vendor lock-in, reduce competition, and concentrate risk in single points of failure.

- **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities:** Outdated infrastructure exposes citizen data to increasing threats. Systems lacking modern security controls (multi-factor authentication, encryption at rest and in transit, continuous monitoring, zero-trust architecture) create organizational risk and compliance challenges.

- **Workforce Skills Gap:** 33% of government workers have low or no digital skills despite 92% of jobs now requiring them. Compensation gaps of 20-40% versus private sector drive technical talent attrition, particularly in high-demand specialties (cloud architecture, data science, cybersecurity, DevOps). The average age of IT workers in government exceeds 50, with retirement wave creating knowledge loss.

- **Service Delivery Gaps:** Only 35-40% of government transactions are completable entirely online as of 2024. Citizens must navigate fragmented services, visit multiple agencies for related needs, and interact with systems designed around bureaucratic structures rather than user needs. Multi-language support and accessibility compliance remain inconsistent.

- **Innovation Deficit:** Risk-averse cultures penalize failure more than they reward innovation. Experimentation requires extensive approvals; pilots struggle to reach production; "not invented here" syndrome limits knowledge sharing across agencies. First-mover disadvantage discourages initiative.

California cannot rely on organic improvement. These structural problems require structural solutions. The state must deliberately create the forcing mechanism that drives efficiency and effectiveness through institutional design.

### 1.5 The Office of Data and Innovation: Pioneer and Partner

The **Office of Data and Innovation (ODI)** has pioneered the approaches this plan scales statewide. Understanding ODI's history, mission, and proven capabilities is essential to understanding how E3 succeeds.

**ODI History and Evolution:**

- **July 1, 2016:** Governor Jerry Brown hired Zachary Townsend as California's inaugural Chief Data Officer within GovOps, signaling commitment to data-driven government
- **July 1, 2019:** Office of Digital Innovation formally established within GovOps under Government Code Section 11546, with statutory mandate to drive innovation across state government
- **2022:** Governor Newsom merged Office of Innovation with CalData, creating the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) to unify data and innovation capabilities under a single office within GovOps

**ODI Mission and Strategic Goals:**

**Mission:** "We drive innovation across California state government, using data, technology, and human-centered design to achieve exceptional, equitable outcomes for all Californians. We collaborate with leaders and communities throughout California and the world. We partner to build empathy for the people we serve and create a government that is easy to interact with and solves big problems."

**Strategic Goals:**
- Develop a statewide culture of innovation that drives efficiency and improves customer experience
- Establish statewide standards to transform service delivery, increase government efficiency, and improve outcomes
- Enable departments to adopt tools and practices that support continuous improvement and performance measurement
- Embed equity in service design and delivery
- Position California as national leader in government innovation

**ODI Programs and Capabilities:**

- **Data and Innovation Fund (DIF):** Legislatively funded partnership program enabling ODI to co-create innovative solutions with state departments; 30+ projects completed since 2022, addressing challenges from social safety net enrollment to fraud detection to service accessibility

- **CalAcademy:** Comprehensive training platform providing courses in human-centered design, plain language, user research, data best practices, innovation methods, and digital service delivery; thousands of state employees trained annually

- **CalInnovate:** Service design, user research, and human-centered design consulting for state departments; partners with agencies to reimagine citizen experiences and identify improvement opportunities

- **CalData:** Open data portal (data.ca.gov) aggregating datasets from multiple agencies; provides transparency, enables research, and supports data-driven decision making

- **Statewide Chief Data Officer:** Housed within ODI, providing data governance leadership, standards development, and coordination across executive branch

- **Generative AI Leadership:** Executive Order N-12-23 tasked ODI with studying AI development, risks, and responsible deployment framework for state government; ODI leads AI governance and ethical use policy development

**ODI's Proven Impact:**

ODI has demonstrated measurable results through collaborative projects:
- Improved social safety net program uptake through better service design and simplified enrollment processes
- Reduced data errors and fraud through analytics, validation, and cross-system verification
- Increased access for historically underrepresented communities through equity-focused design and multi-language support
- Created reusable tools and platforms (California Design System, API standards, data sharing templates) enabling faster department innovation
- Established thought leadership nationally through presentations, publications, and peer state collaboration

**ODI's Role in This Plan:**

The E3 model creates empowered champions at every agency who can mandate adoption of ODI-developed tools, practices, and standards. ODI transitions from optional service provider to essential enabler:

- **Innovation Methods:** CalInnovate approaches become standard practice for all E3 initiatives
- **Training Infrastructure:** CalAcademy becomes foundational training for all E3 leaders, Fellows, and data governance teams
- **Technical Standards:** ODI-developed API standards, data sharing templates, and design systems become mandatory rather than voluntary
- **Partnership Model:** E3 leaders allocate budget for ODI services and mandate department participation in ODI programs
- **Performance Analytics:** ODI expertise supports TMO performance measurement and dashboard development

By embedding ODI methods in E3 structure, proven approaches scale from pilot projects to enterprise-wide practice.

### 1.6 Government Operations Agency: Coordination Hub

The **Government Operations Agency (GovOps)** serves as California's management and efficiency agency, providing the infrastructure and coordination capability essential to E3 success.

**GovOps History and Mission:**

- **Established:** July 1, 2013 through Government Reorganization Plan No. 2
- **Purpose:** Improve management and accountability of state government programs, increase efficiency, promote coordinated operational decisions, and streamline services to Californians
- **Structure:** Cabinet-level agency reporting to Governor

**GovOps Constituent Departments:**
GovOps directly oversees 13 departments, boards, and offices:
- California Department of Technology (CDT) - IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, enterprise architecture
- California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) - workforce management, classification, labor relations
- Department of General Services (DGS) - procurement, real estate, facilities management
- Franchise Tax Board (FTB) - tax administration and collection
- Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) - innovation, data governance, service design
- State Personnel Board (SPB) - merit system oversight
- Office of Administrative Law (OAL) - regulatory review
- And others supporting core government operations

**Current Jurisdictional Scope:**

GovOps' direct authority is primarily limited to these 13 constituent entities. While GovOps can convene, advise, and coordinate across broader state government, it cannot mandate adoption of standards, practices, or technologies in other cabinet agencies (CalHHS, CNRA, Transportation, etc.) without explicit statutory authority or executive direction.

This jurisdictional limitation creates a coordination challenge: GovOps houses the expertise in technology (CDT), innovation (ODI), and workforce management (CalHR) that all agencies need, but lacks authority to mandate their use statewide.

**How E3 Expands GovOps Coordination Capability:**

This Enterprise Modernization Plan establishes a framework that enables GovOps to coordinate statewide efficiency and effectiveness initiatives while respecting the autonomy of other cabinet agencies. The E3 model creates this capability through:

**Transformation Management Office (TMO) within GovOps:**
- Housed within GovOps, TMO provides centralized coordination, portfolio management, performance tracking, and support services
- TMO supports (but does not control) E3 Undersecretaries across all agencies
- Services provided: knowledge management, performance analytics, change management support, innovation coordination, Communities of Practice facilitation
- Creates visibility and accountability without exercising direct authority over other agencies
- GovOps provides infrastructure; agencies maintain autonomy

**Statewide E3 Council:**
- Convened through Governor's Office with TMO providing staff support
- Brings together E3 Undersecretaries from all agencies for coordination, alignment, and peer learning
- GovOps Secretary participates but does not direct other agency E3 leaders
- Creates peer network enabling collaboration and best practice sharing
- Coordination, not command-and-control

**Leveraging GovOps Expertise Statewide:**
- **CDT** provides technology standards, cybersecurity guidance, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise architecture services to all E3 initiatives
- **ODI** provides innovation methods, human-centered design, CalAcademy training, and DIF funding partnerships across all agencies
- **CalHR** provides workforce planning, classification support for data governance teams, and change management guidance statewide
- **DGS** supports procurement innovation, modular contracting, and facilities management for all agencies

The E3 structure transforms GovOps from an agency with limited direct authority into the **coordination hub** for statewide modernization, providing infrastructure, expertise, and support that enables E3 leaders across all agencies to succeed. This respects California's decentralized governance while creating the coordination necessary for enterprise transformation.

```

### 2.2 Undersecretary Positions (Strategic Leadership and Agency Coordination)

**Position Overview:**
Undersecretaries for Efficiency and Effectiveness operate at the Agency level, reporting directly to Agency Secretaries while coordinating statewide efforts through the Transformation Management Office and Statewide E3 Council. These positions hold explicit authority over technology modernization, business process optimization, data governance, and performance management within their agencies.

**Why This Position Matters:**
Without Undersecretaries, modernization efforts fragment across departments with no strategic coordination. Individual departments optimize locally but create incompatibilities system-wide. Undersecretaries provide agency-level strategic direction, ensure cross-department interoperability, allocate resources based on enterprise priorities rather than political influence, and create forcing function for consistent progress. They are the difference between coordinated transformation and chaotic fragmentation.

For sample position descriptions and duty statements, see [Appendix A: Sample Templates and Frameworks](operational-appendices.md#appendix-a-sample-templates-and-frameworks).

These are not advisory or coordinator roles. Undersecretaries have authority to approve major technology investments, mandate cross-department data sharing, redirect resources to strategic initiatives, and hold Chief Deputy Directors accountable for results. They serve as the primary interface between their agencies and both ODI and the Office of State Data Governance, ensuring proven methods and mandatory standards are adopted at scale.

**Deployment Strategy:**

*Recommendation: Begin with 8 Undersecretaries covering the highest-priority agencies, with expansion to 12 based on demonstrated results and Readiness Assessment improvements.*

### 2.3 Chief Deputy Director Positions (Operational Execution and Department Transformation)

**Position Overview:**
Chief Deputy Directors for Efficiency and Effectiveness operate within departments, reporting to Department Directors while coordinating with agency-level Undersecretaries and TMO. These positions hold operational responsibility for modernization execution, managing cross-functional teams including data governance staff and embedded Innovation Fellows.

**Why This Position Matters:**
Department Directors manage complex operations with competing priorities: service delivery, regulatory compliance, budget constraints, legislative mandates, and stakeholder relations. Modernization often falls to the bottom of priority lists without dedicated leadership. Chief Deputy Directors provide persistent focus on transformation, bridging the gap between strategic vision (Undersecretary level) and operational reality (department programs and systems). They translate modernization strategy into tangible improvements citizens experience.

Chief Deputy Directors are hands-on leaders who understand both technology and domain operations. They manage project portfolios, lead business process improvement initiatives, deploy new technologies, ensure data quality, and deliver measurable service improvements. They are the change agents embedded in department operations.

**Deployment Strategy:**

*Recommendation: Deploy 30 Chief Deputy Directors (E3 CDDs) initially to departments with highest readiness and citizen impact, with expansion to 40 based on results.*

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-12):** Deploy to 10 highest-readiness departments (Tier 1 Readiness scores) to establish early wins and demonstrate value
- **Phase 2 (Months 13-24):** Expand to 20 additional departments (Tier 2 with targeted capability building to address specific gaps)
- **Phase 3 (Months 25-36):** Evaluate results and expand to remaining high-impact departments (final deployment of 30-40 total positions based on demonstrated value and Readiness Assessment scores)

### 2.4 Transformation Management Office (TMO)

**Purpose and Strategic Importance:**
The TMO provides centralized coordination, portfolio management, performance tracking, and support services essential to the entire modernization initiative. Without TMO, E3 efforts risk becoming fragmented silos where well-intentioned leaders pursue similar solutions in parallel, wasting resources and foregoing economies of scale.

**Why TMO Matters - The Case for Centralized Coordination:**

Government agencies tend toward independent operation. Decentralization has benefits (autonomy, customization, accountability) but also costs. Without coordination:
- **Duplicated Effort:** Multiple agencies build similar solutions independently (identity management, payment processing, document management)
- **Incompatibility:** Independently developed systems cannot interoperate, preventing data sharing and integrated service delivery
- **Missed Learning:** Successful innovations remain siloed; failures repeat across agencies
- **Resource Waste:** Agencies compete for same vendors, driving up costs; cannot achieve volume discounts
- **Invisible Dependencies:** Projects unknowingly depend on other projects, causing cascading delays when dependencies aren't managed

TMO prevents these pathologies by:
- **Creating Visibility:** Single source of truth for all modernization initiatives statewide; everyone knows what everyone else is doing
- **Managing Dependencies:** Identifying where projects rely on each other; preventing conflicts; enabling sequencing
- **Enabling Reuse:** Capturing what works; packaging for adoption by other departments; preventing reinvention
- **Providing Early Warning:** Detecting troubled projects before they fail catastrophically; enabling intervention
- **Building Community:** Connecting E3 leaders for peer learning, mutual support, and collaborative problem-solving

**Organizational Placement:**
- **Reports to:** Government Operations Agency Secretary
- **Coordinates with:** Statewide E3 Council, ODI, CDT, Office of State Data Governance, Department of Finance
- **Supports:** All Undersecretaries and Chief Deputy Directors across all agencies

**Staffing:**
- **Director:** Executive leadership, external representation, agency Secretary interface, Statewide E3 Council staff support
- **Portfolio Management Team (5-7 staff):** Project pipeline tracking, dependency management, stage-gate reviews, budget/schedule performance monitoring
- **Performance Analytics Team (3-5 staff):** KPI tracking, dashboard production, trend analysis, evaluation, public reporting
- **Change Management Team (3-5 staff):** Training coordination (with CalAcademy), communication support, culture change initiatives, stakeholder engagement

## 3. Independent Office of State Data Governance

> **Section Summary:** This section establishes the Independent Office of State Data Governance with cross-branch authority, including board composition, responsibilities, and standardized data sharing agreement templates.

### 3.1 Constitutional Model and Precedent

The Independent Office of State Data Governance follows California's Little Hoover Commission model: cross-branch appointments, staggered terms, statutory authority, and independence from any single agency.

**Why Independence Matters:**
- E3 leaders need enforceable data sharing authority, not just coordination roles
- Single-agency governance (e.g., within GovOps) lacks legitimacy across other cabinet agencies
- Legislative/judicial branches require data too; executive-only governance excludes them
- Political transitions shouldn't reset data governance; institutional continuity essential

*Note: Establishing the Independent Office of State Data Governance requires enabling legislation. The cross-branch appointment structure and binding authority outlined below cannot be achieved through executive order alone. This recommendation assumes legislative partnership and should be developed in coordination with the Legislature.*

### 3.2 Board Composition (9 Members Minimum)

**Required Seats:**
1. Governor appointment #1
2. Governor appointment #2
3. Senate Rules Committee appointment
4. Assembly Speaker appointment
5. Judicial Council appointment
6. UC Regents representative
7. CSU Board representative
8. **Public seat (REQUIRED)** - citizen perspective, accountability
9. **Breakthrough partner / digital industry representative (REQUIRED)** - private sector expertise, co-learning

**Senior Technical Advisor Requirement:**
Each board seat must have an assigned Senior Technical Advisor who provides technical expertise, reviews standards, and advises their appointing member. These advisors should be experienced technology professionals at a senior level (e.g., senior architects, engineering managers, data science leads, or equivalent)—not necessarily holding a formal "Chief" or "Officer" title. This ensures board decisions are technically sound and implementable while allowing flexibility in how appointing authorities staff this advisory function.

**Term Structure:**
- Staggered 3-year terms
- Survives administration transitions
- Cross-branch legitimacy

### 3.3 Authority and Responsibilities

**Binding Powers:**
- Set statewide data standards (schemas, formats, quality rules)
- Approve/mandate data sharing frameworks
- Convene all branches for policy development
- Enforce compliance through budget/procurement mechanisms

**Key Functions:**
- Develop statewide data architecture
- Resolve inter-agency data disputes
- Protect privacy while enabling sharing
- Annual reporting to Legislature

### 3.4 Data Sharing Agreement Templates

**Why Four Template Types Matter:**

Data sharing negotiations currently take 18 months because every agreement is custom. Standardized templates reduce this to 4-8 weeks by providing pre-approved legal language, technical specifications, and risk mitigation approaches for common scenarios. For a complete sample Data Sharing Agreement (Type 3: Moderate Sensitivity), see [Appendix A.2](operational-appendices.md#a2-data-sharing-agreement-template-type-3-moderate-sensitivity).

**Template 1: Public Data Exchange**
- **Use Case:** Sharing non-sensitive data between state agencies for operational purposes (e.g., business registry data, public facility locations, aggregate statistics)
- **Key Features:** Simple MOU, minimal restrictions, attribution requirements, update frequency specified
- **Approval Time:** 2-4 weeks (department-level approval sufficient)
- **Example:** DMV shares aggregate vehicle registration data with Air Resources Board for emissions modeling

**Template 2: Confidential Data with Limited PII**
- **Use Case:** Sharing data containing some PII but not highly sensitive (e.g., permit applications, licensing records, low-risk health data)
- **Key Features:** Data Use Agreement (DUA), access controls, audit logging, breach notification procedures, retention limits
- **Approval Time:** 4-6 weeks (requires Chief Deputy Director + data governance team review)
- **Example:** Occupational Safety shares workplace injury reports with Public Health for epidemiological analysis (PII minimized)

**Template 3: Sensitive Data Requiring Enhanced Protection**
- **Use Case:** Highly sensitive PII or protected classes (criminal justice, child welfare, mental health, financial information)
- **Key Features:** Enhanced DUA, role-based access, encryption requirements, independent privacy review, limited retention, strict purpose limitation
- **Approval Time:** 6-8 weeks (requires Undersecretary + Independent Office privacy review)
- **Example:** Corrections shares inmate release data with Social Services for reentry support program eligibility

**Template 4: Cross-Branch or External Entity Sharing**
- **Use Case:** Sharing between executive/legislative/judicial branches or with federal/local governments, academic institutions, or (rarely) private entities
- **Key Features:** Formal inter-branch agreement, explicit statutory authority cited, strict purpose limitation, public transparency requirements, sunset clauses
- **Approval Time:** 8-12 weeks (requires Independent Office board approval)
- **Example:** Executive branch shares arrest data with Judicial Council for pretrial release research; or sharing Medi-Cal data with federal HHS for program oversight

**Benefits of Templates:**
- **Speed:** 90% reduction in negotiation time
- **Legal clarity:** Pre-vetted language reduces risk
- **Consistency:** Similar use cases treated similarly
- **Transparency:** Public can see standard terms
- **Scalability:** New agreements use proven patterns

## 4. Product-Led Delivery Framework

> **Section Summary:** This section describes the technical delivery approach, including service mesh architecture, citizen journey teams, and integration with procurement. For detailed procurement procedures, see [Procurement Guide](procurement-guide.md).

### 4.1 Service Mesh Architecture

**Vision:** Replace monolithic point-to-point integrations with service mesh where every system exposes APIs and discovers services through a catalog.

**API Standards:**
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0+ specs
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Agency API catalogs for discovery
- Semantic versioning, backward compatibility
- Rate limiting and monitoring

**Implementation:**
1. Pilot with high-value cross-agency services
2. Mandate for all new procurements
3. Retrofit legacy with API wrappers
4. TMO maintains statewide catalog

### 4.2 Citizen Journey Teams

**Organizing Around Life Events:**

Traditional government organizes around agencies. Citizens experience life events that require multiple agencies:
- Having a baby (Health, Vital Records, Social Services, Tax)
- Starting a business (Secretary of State, Tax, Licensing, Permitting)
- Disaster recovery (Emergency Services, Housing, Insurance, Small Business)

Citizen Journey Teams bring together E3 leaders, SMEs, and Fellows from relevant agencies to redesign experiences around these journeys, creating seamless integrated services.

### 4.3 Procurement Integration

Product-led delivery requires procurement that moves at the speed of product development. California integrates contracting directly into the Product Delivery Lifecycle through:

- **Enterprise Vendor Pools:** Pre-qualified vendors ready for task orders in days, not months
- **Modular Contracting:** $15M cap forcing smaller, manageable contracts with reduced risk
- **Rapid RFI²:** Challenge-based procurement validating solutions through paid prototypes in 8-10 weeks

For complete procurement framework, policies, and operational details, see [Procurement Guide](procurement-guide.md).
