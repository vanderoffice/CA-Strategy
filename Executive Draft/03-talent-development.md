**Expected Outcomes:**
- Actionable recommendations for enterprise-wide improvements
- Some initiatives directly transition to Breakthrough Fund projects
- Fellows gain experience leading complex, cross-agency initiatives; graduates become Senior Fellows

### 5.2 Post-Fellowship Engagement

Upon graduation, Fellows become **Senior Fellows** and join a permanent network of modernization leaders.

**On-Call Subject Matter Expert Network:**

**Structure:**
- All Senior Fellows remain available to ODI for ongoing modernization work
- 5-10 hours/month average time commitment (flexible based on project needs)
- Paid as consulting engagement or detail from home agency
- Quarterly meetings of SME network for knowledge sharing

**Activation:**
- Specific initiatives needing expertise (e.g., Senior Fellow led similar project)
- Departmental requests for support (e.g., Senior Fellow embedded in that department)
- Breakthrough Fund project support
- Capacity augmentation during peak periods

**Emergency Response Capacity:**

**Roster:**
- Emergency response roster of Senior Fellows from past 3-5 years
- Categorized by expertise (IT systems, data, cybersecurity, operations, communications)
- Pre-authorized for rapid activation
- **Voluntary participation:** Senior Fellows may opt out of the emergency roster at any time based on personal circumstances, workload, or other factors

**Activation Scenarios:**
- IT system failures requiring immediate response
- Cybersecurity incidents needing surge capacity
- Natural disaster response coordination
- Pandemic or public health emergency
- Any operational crisis requiring expert support

**Response Protocol:**
- Rapid activation (24-48 hours notice)
- 3-5 Senior Fellows assembled based on relevant expertise and availability
- Intensive engagement for duration of crisis (typically 2-6 weeks)
- Full-time detail from home agency or emergency contract

**Statewide Advisory Services:**

Senior Fellows are available to provide advisory support to any state department or agency:

- **Consultation requests:** Departments may request Senior Fellow expertise through ODI
- **Advisory engagements:** Short-term advisory support (hours to days) on specific modernization challenges
- **Expert matching:** ODI maintains a directory of Senior Fellow expertise areas to match advisors with departmental needs
- **No-cost consultation:** Initial advisory consultations provided at no cost to requesting departments
- **Extended engagements:** Longer advisory relationships arranged through interagency agreements or TMO coordination

**Sustainability Model:**

With 6-month cohorts starting every 4 months, California builds sustained Senior Fellow capacity:

- **After 12 months:** 40 Senior Fellows (2 cohorts graduated)
- **After 18 months:** 60 Senior Fellows (3 cohorts graduated)
- **After 24 months:** 80 Senior Fellows (4 cohorts graduated)
- **After 36 months:** 120+ Senior Fellows (6+ cohorts graduated)

This creates a self-sustaining pipeline that compounds over time, with Senior Fellows deployed throughout state government driving continuous modernization.

### 5.3 Executive Duty Statement Integration

**Positioning Fellowship as Desired Qualification:**

As executive positions open or are reclassified, include fellowship participation as "desirable" or "highly valued" qualification.

**Sample Duty Statement Language:**

> **Desirable Qualifications:**
> Completion of Governor's Innovation Fellowship (Senior Fellow status) or equivalent executive leadership development program focused on organizational modernization, cross-functional collaboration, and enterprise perspective. Senior Fellows bring demonstrated understanding of state government systems, authentic relationships across multiple departments, hands-on experience with change management in complex organizations, and commitment to evidence-based modernization.

**Implementation Phases:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Pilot in 10-15 senior positions
- Chief Data Officer and modernization officer roles

- Positions where enterprise perspective critical
- Cross-functional roles requiring collaboration
- Innovation and transformation leadership roles

**Phase 3 (Years 2-3):** Standardize across 40-50+ executive-level roles
- Routine inclusion in executive position duty statements
- Integration into succession planning
- Recognition as premier leadership development pathway

**Benefits:**

**For Senior Fellows:**
- Competitive advantage in advancement
- Clear career pathway to executive roles
- Recognition of skills and experience
- Return on investment in Fellowship participation

**For State:**
- Leaders with enterprise perspective (not siloed)
- Established relationships enabling collaboration

### 5.4 Data Governance Teams (Permanent State Staff)

**Purpose:**

Provide sustainable capacity to support current Fellows' projects and sustain innovations after Fellows graduate to Senior Fellow status. Data governance teams are permanent civil service staff providing ongoing data management, quality, and integration capabilities.

**Blended Expertise Model:**

Effective data governance requires combining domain expertise with technical data skills:

**Domain Specialists:**
- Scientists, engineers, and subject matter experts (existing classifications)
- Understand what data means, where it comes from, regulatory requirements
- Apply professional judgment to data quality and interpretation
- Ensure data governance aligns with programmatic needs

**Data Specialists:**
- Data architects, engineers, and analysts
- Build systems, pipelines, and integration infrastructure
- Implement technical data quality controls
- Enable self-service analytics and reporting

**Why Both Are Essential:**
- Domain specialists alone lack technical skills to implement solutions
- Data specialists alone lack context to make correct decisions about data
- Combined expertise delivers effective data governance

**Why Science and Engineering Classifications:**

**Higher Compensation:**
- Professional classifications pay 20-30% more than administrative equivalents
- Essential for recruiting talent with technical degrees and expertise
- Competitive with private sector data roles (though still 20-40% gap)

**Critical Thinking Skills:**
- Scientists and engineers trained in analytical thinking, experimentation, validation
- Apply scientific method to data problems
- Comfortable with uncertainty and complexity

**Domain Expertise:**
- Many government datasets require domain knowledge (environmental, engineering, health, public safety)
- Professional classifications enable hiring experts who understand the data

**Classification Alignment:**
- Consistent with how California already organizes technical work
- Leverages existing classification infrastructure
- Reduces HR complexity and approval challenges

**Professional Accountability:**

**Supervisory-Level Authority:**
- Supervisory classifications provide "responsible charge" over data systems and quality
- Similar to engineering supervisors responsible for project quality and safety
- Creates accountability for data governance outcomes

**Licensure (Where Applicable):**
- PE/PG licensure preferred for certain roles (engineering data systems, geospatial analysis)
- Professional ethics and standards applicable to data work
- Continuing education requirements keeping skills current

**Quality Requirements:**
- Classification standards embed scientific and engineering quality expectations
- Performance standards tied to data quality, accuracy, compliance
- Career advancement linked to demonstrated expertise and impact

**Deployment Strategy:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-12): Pilot Deployment**
- 3-5 pilot departments selected based on Readiness Assessment
- Full team deployment with intensive support from TMO and ODI
- Establish team operating models and best practices
- Document lessons learned for broader rollout

**Phase 2 (Months 13-24): Scaling**
- 15-20 departments receive data governance teams
- Leverage pilot learnings and templates
- Communities of Practice connecting teams across departments
- Shared services (e.g., data infrastructure, training) reducing duplication

**Phase 3 (Months 25-36): Statewide Deployment**
- Complete deployment to 30 departments with dedicated teams
- Establish 6-8 regional data governance hubs serving remaining departments
- Mature operating model and standards
- Self-sustaining communities supporting each other
- Integration with Office of State Data Governance standards

**Deployment Model:**

| Tier | Departments | Model | Staffing |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Tier 1-2** (Dedicated Teams) | 30 largest departments (~85% of IT spend) | Full 13-15 FTE data governance team | 390-450 positions |
| **Tier 3-4** (Shared Services) | 140 smaller departments | Regional hub support + TMO technical assistance | 6-8 hubs × 8-10 FTE = 48-80 positions |
| **Total** | 170 departments | Hybrid model | **438-530 positions** |

**Regional Hub Structure:**
- 6-8 hubs geographically distributed (Northern CA, Bay Area, Central Valley, Greater LA, etc.)
- Each hub serves 15-25 smaller departments
- Hub services: data quality consulting, standards implementation, training, technical assistance
- Departments retain ownership; hubs provide expertise and surge capacity

**Expected Impact:**
- 95%+ data quality for critical datasets (up from 60-70% baseline)
- 80% reduction in data sharing negotiation time (from 12-18 months to 4-8 weeks for standard scenarios using templates)
- 50%+ increase in data-driven decision making (measured by analytics tool usage)
- 438-530 permanent civil service positions created (390-450 in dedicated teams, 48-80 in regional hubs)
- Sustainable capacity independent of Fellowship program or external consultants

- Annual continuing education requirement (minimum 40 hours/year)
- Specialization tracks for advanced skills

**Target:** 100% of data governance team members trained in foundational competencies by Year 2

### 5.6 Labor Relations

Successful modernization requires partnership with labor organizations representing state employees. Key principles include:

- **No Involuntary Separations:** Efficiency gains redirect staff to higher-value work, not unemployment
- **Early Engagement:** Unions consulted before, not after, modernization decisions
- **Upskilling Priority:** Training programs prepare workers for evolving roles
- **Classification Coordination:** New data governance positions developed in coordination with CalHR and relevant bargaining units

For comprehensive guidance on union engagement, workforce transitions, and training coordination, see [Appendix B.4: Labor Relations Strategy](07-operational-guides.md#b4-labor-relations-strategy).
